Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the Decent.

1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,599
I'm your host as always Ricardo

2
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:08,449
Loops. And today I'm joined by Doctor Claudio 10.

3
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:12,979
He is a tenured research group leader in the Department

4
00:00:12,989 --> 00:00:17,139
of Early Prehistory and Quaternary Ecology at the University of

5
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:17,940
Tubingen.

6
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:19,979
This is our second interview.

7
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:23,690
I'm leaving the link to our first one in the description box.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,979
Uh And today we're going to talk basically about

9
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:31,579
the differences between ape culture and human culture.

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,900
So, Doctor 10 Year, welcome back to the show. It's always a pleasure to talk to you.

11
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,590
It's a great pleasure to talk to you and thank

12
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:40,279
you very much for having me a second time.

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:40,700
Thanks,

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,159
great. So OK, let's perhaps start with some basics here.

15
00:00:47,169 --> 00:00:52,819
Uh How would you define ape culture? What is ape culture?

16
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:53,770
Right?

17
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:57,029
Yeah. Well, uh ape culture would be cultures

18
00:00:57,259 --> 00:00:59,599
um shown by apes.

19
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,290
But when we talk about culture generally,

20
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:06,430
and this is uh always news for newcomers to the field. At first,

21
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:09,709
it turns out that culture is quite a slippery fish.

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:16,720
It's quite difficult to uh measure it to, to really get hold of uh culture generally,

23
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:17,809
not just in apes

24
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:18,800
anywhere.

25
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:25,169
And um to see why that is, you know, we can imagine that we can measure genes, you know,

26
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,410
the existence of genes.

27
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:27,000
Anyway,

28
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,230
um what to make with this data is a different matter.

29
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:32,559
But we can measure them, you know, we can find them

30
00:01:33,029 --> 00:01:34,160
same for environment.

31
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:38,410
You know, we can measure the temperature somewhere, we can measure the humidity,

32
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,849
uh someplace and so on.

33
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,879
But with culture, it is difficult, it continues to be difficult to really measure

34
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:49,959
our culture. Culture is something that happens out in the world

35
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:54,599
sometimes stays out in the world such as cultural artifacts and so on.

36
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:59,279
But it is also something that is very much in minds in brains.

37
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:04,080
And we don't have very good means to get to these brains, you know, uh

38
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,910
it's not something that I personally do, for example.

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,690
So the general approach had been then in the past,

40
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:15,990
in order to try to pinpoint culture is to take away

41
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,860
the signal and the factors from other um uh areas. So, for example, to try to find,

42
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:27,380
if you control for, if you measure and,

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,869
and um adjust for genetic differences,

44
00:02:31,399 --> 00:02:33,500
and if you measure and control

45
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:36,770
for environmental differences between populations,

46
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:38,880
if you do both of these things,

47
00:02:39,179 --> 00:02:42,940
the idea is that what is left over, if there is some difference,

48
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:45,539
still left over between these populations,

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,990
that you can call that difference

50
00:02:48,389 --> 00:02:49,419
um cut.

51
00:02:49,809 --> 00:02:54,070
So it's an approach that the philosophers call an X Negativo

52
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:55,000
approach.

53
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,960
It's basically defining

54
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,600
uh something by

55
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,669
uh the absence of all the other things. Um And that is what, what culture has been

56
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:07,699
uh come to be seen. And also in the apes,

57
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,300
I can talk more later, maybe about this,

58
00:03:10,309 --> 00:03:14,550
but population differences between apes that are not very

59
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:19,720
obviously linked to genetic differences and um environmental differences,

60
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,270
that's what people call ape culture.

61
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:30,820
Uh And so, uh I would imagine that we can study ape culture through different means.

62
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,520
So I guess that perhaps some aspects of it could be studied

63
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:41,300
in the lab, but we can also study ape culture in the wild. So,

64
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:42,369
um

65
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,470
uh what do we know about wild ape culture?

66
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:51,990
And is it similar or different to human culture?

67
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,789
Yes. So wild ape culture is a prototypical case

68
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,410
of ape culture. Wild ape culture is what most people focus on. Really

69
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,100
when you,

70
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,089
when you open up your TV channel and you

71
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,539
see David Attenborough come up and talk about,

72
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:11,320
I don't know chimpanzee nut cracking or something and so on.

73
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,850
And then they would invariably talk about some culture

74
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:15,649
there.

75
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:19,769
That's what they are ultimately uh on about, they talk about these

76
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,549
dissimilarities between populations and they call that

77
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:26,170
um culture.

78
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,730
And again, uh

79
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,489
when, when you ask about the similarities, now,

80
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,049
now we get into the topic of what we are talking about today.

81
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,750
Um The similarities uh there is some similarity in

82
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,679
the sense that indeed we also see in humans,

83
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:44,929
population differences, right,

84
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,170
the way that I eat uh rice might be

85
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:51,149
different to how some other people and some other populations

86
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,029
eat rice. Right? So there are some differences

87
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,619
and these differences can indeed be meaningfully linked

88
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:03,429
to some cultural processes. So on that level, on the surface level,

89
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:05,649
we are dealing with a similar phenomenon,

90
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,959
we are dealing with population differences.

91
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:12,309
And by the way, if somebody were to say this is a cultural difference, you know,

92
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,989
on this very rough level, just to talk about culture per se,

93
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:18,730
I have no problem with that.

94
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:22,480
Um uh If you know, if the method of exclusion,

95
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:26,290
that's this method to exclude genetic and environmental differences.

96
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,390
If, if it had been applied correctly,

97
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,899
uh then, you know, I have no problem with that.

98
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,589
But this does not mean

99
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,570
that the culture specifics

100
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:37,380
underlying these cases

101
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:40,269
are or must be the same.

102
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:42,739
And this is basically

103
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:48,339
where I have the biggest difficulties always in getting our main point across

104
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,390
the main point from my research group

105
00:05:50,619 --> 00:05:55,339
is to say they, that is not to say that apes don't have culture.

106
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,420
This is a point that is very frequently misconstruct.

107
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,779
The point is not to say that apes don't have culture. The point is to say Ape

108
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,940
apes have culture, but that culture might be very different

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,059
from the culture of humans.

110
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,519
That's essentially our main point here.

111
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:17,959
Um Yeah, but, but, but, but the rest of the devil is in the details and so on.

112
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,500
Uh But I'm sure we're gonna get to this. Yeah.

113
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:24,739
But do you think that when studying a culture,

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,540
uh we have to be careful about, uh

115
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:35,089
what would probably be some of the differences that arise between, for example,

116
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,170
studying it

117
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,769
uh when the animals are

118
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,859
uh captive versus uh in the wild?

119
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:44,700
Um

120
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,359
Well, there are different opinions on that. Uh

121
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:48,500
The,

122
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:50,390
the opinion,

123
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:54,239
the main opinion is, I guess for most people

124
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:55,880
out in the world,

125
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:59,089
many, most people are very interested in apes generally

126
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,320
and they are somehow very interested in ape culture generally.

127
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,200
But when they are interested in these things, they are usually interested most

128
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:11,329
in the wild ape cultural case.

129
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:12,989
However,

130
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:15,709
you can also do similar methods,

131
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,910
you can apply them across different populations of captive apes, for example.

132
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,279
And then you can find also

133
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:26,769
some population differences between these captive populations

134
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:32,149
that suggests, it suggests that perhaps we are dealing here with similar

135
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,190
phenomenon,

136
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,470
meaning that the similar phenomenon might be

137
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,089
underlain by very similar mechanisms as well.

138
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,040
But here is where then some people um

139
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:45,459
disagree. Some people would then say

140
00:07:45,619 --> 00:07:50,279
there is a, there is a big difference between wild apes and captive apes.

141
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,470
And uh that is, I mean,

142
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,970
theoretically speaking, you know, that could well be.

143
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,970
Um but then you look at the arguments and the

144
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:01,660
there is already a problem,

145
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,500
the arguments that people then bring are go

146
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,339
are pointing to completely the opposite patterns.

147
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,299
So

148
00:08:09,579 --> 00:08:11,239
I'm not explaining this very well.

149
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:15,070
People make different claims

150
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,589
with regard to this difference,

151
00:08:17,859 --> 00:08:19,670
wildly different claims. So

152
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,500
some people essentially claim I,

153
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,739
I have to turn this down a little bit here because we don't have much time.

154
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:28,660
Um So I'm painting with a very broad brush here.

155
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,090
Some people would then say that um captive apes are stupid.

156
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,989
Again, I'm painting with a broad brush.

157
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,030
Uh So then they would say the captive apes, they,

158
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,049
they can't do very much and so on the wild apes,

159
00:08:42,058 --> 00:08:45,270
they can do many more things and they are really clever ones and so on.

160
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,960
So these people would then essentially claim that captivity impoverishes

161
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,150
the cognition,

162
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:52,760
um

163
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:56,309
intelligence if you so on, you know, of these things.

164
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,750
But then you look and some other people

165
00:08:59,989 --> 00:09:01,849
say the exact opposite.

166
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,969
They say actually, you know,

167
00:09:03,979 --> 00:09:08,070
there is a thing they call it a captivity effect doesn't matter what it's called now.

168
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,450
And they say, oh actually, it turns out that the captive ones,

169
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,549
they are the ones that are showing improved cognition.

170
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:20,659
So there is a huge problem here. And um

171
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,549
logically speaking,

172
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:29,140
uh unless you finesse it down into more details, logically speaking, on this level,

173
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,880
one side must be wrong, right?

174
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:35,989
It cannot be both correct that they are impoverished and improved in,

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,150
in their cognition.

176
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,109
So that's already shown

177
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:40,530
you um

178
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,320
part of the divide that we have in the field where

179
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:49,190
people talk about different things without even agreeing on the basics,

180
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,479
even agreeing, they can't even agree on the overall patterns

181
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:55,330
as it were.

182
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,030
But if you can't agree on this overall patterns, and it will be very difficult also to

183
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:04,450
frankly answer once and for all the questions that you ask me, it's a good question.

184
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,739
You know, is there a difference between the culture of the captive apes and the word?

185
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,210
And there currently it depends who you ask.

186
00:10:12,349 --> 00:10:17,530
Those people who say that uh the the uh captive apes are impoverished,

187
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:20,650
they will give you a different answer than those who say uh

188
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:24,710
you know, that the captive apes are improved in their cognition or enhanced

189
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:26,289
in their cognition.

190
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,900
I personally think

191
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:32,010
that the difference between wild apes and captive apes

192
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:35,989
doesn't go as extreme in one direction

193
00:10:36,409 --> 00:10:37,349
or the other

194
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:40,419
as some of these scams have been made, right?

195
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:42,989
Uh I think also if you, if you think about it for a second,

196
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,200
the fact that that

197
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,840
can be people who, who promote the idea that, you know,

198
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,080
the the difference is like this, you know,

199
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,760
and the others promote the exact opposite uh idea.

200
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,080
Well, maybe what really is happening is that the,

201
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,210
the real difference is not all that great.

202
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,359
And indeed, um

203
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:07,989
unless we talk about incarcerated apes and so on so forth, we, we might do so later.

204
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,739
Um

205
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,229
Unless you talk about this, the difference is not that great.

206
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:20,000
Uh And so my answer then would be quite similar. My answer would be to say,

207
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,400
captive apes are also

208
00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:27,840
able to um have an ape culture just like wild apes do.

209
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:31,119
It's just that most people focus on white ape culture.

210
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,359
-- That would be my my personal short answer to
-- that question.

211
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:36,750
But I mean,

212
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,770
I've also asked you about that because sometimes

213
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,969
when we talk about studies that are done

214
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,809
in uh not only with animals but also with uh humans

215
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,900
in the lab, uh There are people

216
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,010
uh that bring to the table criticisms regarding for example, ecological validity,

217
00:11:58,039 --> 00:11:58,690
right?

218
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,140
Of those studies. But

219
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,010
I mean,

220
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:07,250
perhaps I'm saying something that is completely wrong and if so please correct me.

221
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,590
But

222
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:09,239
uh I mean,

223
00:12:09,469 --> 00:12:17,780
I I if um couldn't we treat, let's say captive animals or animals studied in the lab

224
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:23,799
as uh I mean, those artificial settings as

225
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:26,650
a different ecology.

226
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,820
I mean, would that make sense?

227
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:33,000
It would, it would absolutely make sense. You know, we can even go into an evil

228
00:12:33,109 --> 00:12:33,979
route. You could,

229
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:36,239
you could and people have done that.

230
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,590
Unfortunately, in the past, you can take um single chimpanzees, right?

231
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,599
So you it's a social animal

232
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,479
and you better treat them as social animals and you keep them as social animals but,

233
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:48,119
but people have taken them

234
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:49,919
and put them in single cages

235
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:54,030
and that's not only is that super cruel, we don't need to talk about that.

236
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,159
Everybody would agree that that's a cool thing to do

237
00:12:56,669 --> 00:12:59,570
but that kind of thing, that kind of thing

238
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:03,609
I am convinced that that does deprive these

239
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:07,150
apes and it leads to impoverished cognition.

240
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:07,690
So

241
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:11,109
how, how can we expand from this uh case?

242
00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:13,719
Right, we can expand from it in, in the following way, I think

243
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:18,580
we can ask the the more sensible question and the question that can be measured

244
00:13:18,859 --> 00:13:20,500
like how

245
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,799
similar to the wild do we need to create conditions

246
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:28,340
in order to make these cases ecologically comparable?

247
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:30,799
This is very important because

248
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:33,270
when we do that, we see that

249
00:13:33,599 --> 00:13:38,520
there is not one type of ecology for chimpanzees. Let's talk about chimpanzees.

250
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,010
Generally,

251
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,299
we can talk about all the A I DS but chimpanzees are the typical case to talk about.

252
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:47,729
So when we look at chimpanzees across, you know, Africa, uh

253
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:50,349
we see that they live too in

254
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:53,669
very widely different situations in different environments,

255
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,090
you know,

256
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,000
but also in different sizes of populations.

257
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:03,270
That is simply the case, right? Um So some live in small populations

258
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,340
actually, you know,

259
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:07,390
this is there is also an interference with human observation there,

260
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,349
but let's not go in in that direction.

261
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:10,505
Um

262
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,815
And some live in very big uh uh environments

263
00:14:13,945 --> 00:14:18,674
um in big groups and they live in this different environments too. So

264
00:14:18,794 --> 00:14:22,145
what we can glean from that is the following, we can glean from that.

265
00:14:22,155 --> 00:14:22,434
And,

266
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,914
and we can also imagine that in the past

267
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:27,554
in the environment of evolutionary adapted this of,

268
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:29,155
of uh chimpanzees and so on.

269
00:14:29,164 --> 00:14:34,434
In the past, there were very likely more variability in their living conditions.

270
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,190
So

271
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,460
actually

272
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:42,369
many different environments, social environments and physical environments,

273
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,979
many different environments

274
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:46,979
are compatible within chimpanzee life,

275
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:52,460
which means that this is good news as it were for those captive workers.

276
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:56,979
Because now it's not altogether immediately clear that if you have

277
00:14:56,989 --> 00:15:00,719
a good zoo that provide the aids with uh big enclosure,

278
00:15:00,729 --> 00:15:04,369
say that keep them in uh social settings, the chimpanzees,

279
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,559
especially in social settings, right?

280
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,369
It's not immediately obvious and it's not an immediate,

281
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:10,859
you know,

282
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:15,539
Trump card against captive work to say that there are

283
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:18,530
some differences between this situation and the wild situations.

284
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:21,250
You know, you can always find the differences. Yes.

285
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:23,770
But the question is, how much do they matter?

286
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:29,150
And if you frame it like that, I think it's easy to see that the answer will depend,

287
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:29,650
right?

288
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:35,619
I would, I would say uh some zoos are more ecologically relevant or similar

289
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:39,799
to the range of environments that uh wild apes

290
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,989
have, right? Some are less, you know,

291
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,440
yes, in an ideal world, you, you take that into account,

292
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,099
but that's why we always report also where we run our studies.

293
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,140
So later meta reviews and so on can look out for these things.

294
00:15:54,049 --> 00:15:55,750
But as I said earlier,

295
00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:00,650
when we actually look, the differences don't seem to be all that great.

296
00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:04,349
Again, if people have widely different opinions on that.

297
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,429
Probably the truth is somewhere in the middle, which in this case means

298
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,109
they are not altogether incomparable. Yes.

299
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:19,929
So, uh going back to the wild apes specifically earlier, I asked you,

300
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:23,849
uh if their culture is similar or different

301
00:16:23,859 --> 00:16:27,270
to humans when it comes to the differences,

302
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,840
do we know exactly what they are

303
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:35,349
in what ways wild health culture is different from

304
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:36,909
the human culture?

305
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:38,590
Um

306
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:40,979
Well, many people, when you ask them,

307
00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:44,789
many people would point immediately to language

308
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,229
and they would say humans have language and AIDS, don't

309
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,270
that's what many people would say

310
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,700
to a large degree. I think it's true.

311
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:54,979
Then again,

312
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,929
when, when, when you look more closely, well, what is language?

313
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,640
Language is a form of communication, right? OK. Do apes have communication?

314
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,439
Surely they have communication, right?

315
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,819
They even have a communication on different channels, you know,

316
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:11,800
they can uh use gestures, they can use sounds, you know, so

317
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:16,130
it's not that there is a complete lack of complexity, say in their,

318
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,670
in their communication, right?

319
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,040
And then you get into essentially linguistics,

320
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,319
lin

321
00:17:21,469 --> 00:17:23,810
linguistic debates which are always

322
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:29,030
tough to follow, let's say, right? Uh They are more for the specialists.

323
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,589
And so let me just summarize what I think most linguists would say.

324
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:37,650
They would say while that is true that they have this communication, et cetera,

325
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,010
et cetera.

326
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,420
There are some big differences still

327
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,339
and

328
00:17:41,699 --> 00:17:46,109
what you always find every year when you, when you look at this literature, you know,

329
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:50,829
the the the aid researchers, they, they chip away every year a little bit, you know,

330
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:53,180
they chip away at these differences, right?

331
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:57,640
But the chips that they remove are usually not very, very large. So

332
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,069
the the the overall picture is that

333
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,420
a communication does,

334
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:06,920
I think that it is fair to say does get closer to human language over time.

335
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,260
But the steps don't seem to be

336
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,660
as big as they would ever reach a complete overlap. Let me put it this

337
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:15,859
way, right? I'm not

338
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,199
an ape language researcher. Let me, let me, let me say it like that.

339
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:21,780
But that is my interpretation

340
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,079
from all of this.

341
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:23,729
But

342
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,890
in my own approach, I try to go one step deeper.

343
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,739
I take the following as um as granted,

344
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,000
one major assumption

345
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:37,449
of my, my work is also and I take this from the linguists.

346
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,530
Um they describe language in all kinds of ways and some

347
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:46,479
specifics of languages also that we learn from each other,

348
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,380
the words or in gestural language, you know,

349
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,170
in sign language that the specific gestures

350
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:56,530
from each other, right? The fact that we speak English together, right?

351
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,969
Uh I think none

352
00:18:58,074 --> 00:19:00,494
of us as a as a native speaker, right?

353
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:03,844
That is because we learned these things from

354
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:05,994
others and also even our native languages,

355
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:06,655
we learned

356
00:19:06,785 --> 00:19:10,494
these things from others, right? We learned these words from others.

357
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:18,135
But then what are words in a in a way um words are a specific type of information.

358
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,449
Um It's in the vocal domain, let's stick with the vocal domain now.

359
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,630
And it's sequences of certain pronunciations and so on that you

360
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,859
really have to learn as this all sequences a slow.

361
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,270
And in my lab, we, we call

362
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:39,709
this and other cases, we call that, know how, know how

363
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,459
to pronounce a word,

364
00:19:42,099 --> 00:19:44,250
know how to pronounce the word

365
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,329
uh printer, know how to pronounce the word word water bottle. You know,

366
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,290
that, that kind of thing it is about, know how and, and I know uh you know, I've,

367
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:56,209
I've moved away quite a bit from your original question.

368
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:56,989
I haven't forgotten

369
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:01,089
the question was what is the difference between ape and human culture?

370
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:01,729
Right?

371
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,939
OK. So let's take for granted that language is still the big difference maker.

372
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:09,959
But now we see that in order to get language,

373
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:13,400
you need several factors as the linguist, they've got whole list.

374
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,619
But one of these factors that is necessary is that

375
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:21,640
you need to be able to copy arbitrary strings,

376
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,000
arbitrary, know how.

377
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,550
And another way of saying that is you need to copy,

378
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:34,250
know how that you yourself will not have come up with uh any time in your life unless

379
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:36,420
you had copied it from others.

380
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,420
So nobody wakes up in the morning without ever having had contact with uh Mandarin

381
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,500
and speaks Mandarin. You know that that is just not

382
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,859
the case. We all know this,

383
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:51,260
but the the background to that is that it consists among other things

384
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:56,939
of know how pronouncing all these words um that we could not just produce

385
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:57,670
our own.

386
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,540
So our lab, we call that

387
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,160
and I know it's a bit of a mouthful, right?

388
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,349
We call that super

389
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:04,930
individual,

390
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,219
know how s

391
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:07,280
above

392
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,569
individual beyond the individual. No,

393
00:21:10,949 --> 00:21:12,099
is the term.

394
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,849
The whole idea goes back to classical uh research and cultural evolution.

395
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:19,359
The whole idea goes back to Boyd and Richardson

396
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,099
who pointed out that,

397
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,729
you know, a special type of culture, cumulative culture,

398
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,550
I would like to add cumulative culture of know how

399
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,739
produces, you know, ways of doing things and so on.

400
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,609
Um

401
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,640
that nobody on their own could develop uh from scratch

402
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:37,979
anymore.

403
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,170
So we just, you know, we just gave this a label.

404
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,369
Uh We, we specified a little bit more,

405
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,050
we said it's about know how and we specified uh you know, the whole idea

406
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,114
in the extrovert super individual. So

407
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:54,084
the difference then, and this is the high positive,

408
00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:56,824
but it's really very well supported by now,

409
00:21:57,045 --> 00:22:02,905
the difference is that humans have recounted them roughly and we found billions,

410
00:22:02,915 --> 00:22:05,704
billions of cases of super individual know-how

411
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:08,984
across the whole planet, across all humans, billions.

412
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,119
And then in the case of the apes, you know, do they have super individual?

413
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,930
Know how, I mean, the interview is continuing, we can talk more about that.

414
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:19,859
But let me give you a very rough answer.

415
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,959
And the answer is

416
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,290
if,

417
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:25,000
if apes

418
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:26,599
have,

419
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,140
I should specify un incarcerated, untrained apes,

420
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:34,859
if they have super individual know how they have it in very rare cases.

421
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,270
So a

422
00:22:36,729 --> 00:22:40,369
couple of cases, maybe a handful of cases,

423
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,349
but maybe also they have none and these handful of cases may be illusions.

424
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:46,180
Um

425
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,810
But then we have the answer in focus. Now the answer is essentially

426
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,859
uh human life would be widely different. What is inconceivable in its current form.

427
00:22:56,949 --> 00:23:00,760
If we were to take all these super individual know how away

428
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:03,689
everything would come to a grinding halt.

429
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:06,415
We wouldn't have computers, we wouldn't have language,

430
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:08,885
we wouldn't have any of these things, you know, you and I,

431
00:23:08,895 --> 00:23:12,814
we wouldn't uh be able to talk to each other, you and I, we wouldn't have names,

432
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:13,214
you know.

433
00:23:13,344 --> 00:23:13,974
So

434
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:19,665
that is what, what my approach has been for for many years now.

435
00:23:19,974 --> 00:23:23,905
Um to say that the difference is that we humans, we are

436
00:23:24,114 --> 00:23:27,165
um we, we are able to copy, know how,

437
00:23:27,175 --> 00:23:31,135
even if there's no how it is super individual and we indeed do.

438
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,324
-- And we have created all of this around us in this
-- way.

439
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:38,290
OK. So perhaps I could save this question for later.

440
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:43,160
But since you brought it already to the table, let's censor it now. So

441
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:49,750
uh you mentioned there the question, I mean, if other apes have some,

442
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,459
some form of super individual know how uh

443
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,560
I mean, what are examples of that.

444
00:23:57,599 --> 00:23:58,160
And I mean,

445
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:05,000
what are examples of that where some people might claim that they in fact have that?

446
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,069
Yes. So um

447
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:09,359
here is it is an interesting approach.

448
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:13,729
If you do the data approach, where you actually look systematically,

449
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,469
what are these cases,

450
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,000
you find actually a different answer

451
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,579
than when you ask people like that at a conference.

452
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:25,439
For example, when II I do this kind of thing as well, I ask around, you know, I,

453
00:24:25,449 --> 00:24:26,359
I talk to people.

454
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:30,219
So when I explain what I'm after and I explain, you know,

455
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:36,540
I'm I'm after know how not know where food is, not know what food is.

456
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,280
You know, this thing, whether it's that thing,

457
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:42,819
we all know that apes can learn socially also about these things.

458
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:43,839
When I say no, no,

459
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,880
we are talking about know how more specifically not

460
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:48,800
know how that they can do on their own,

461
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,569
what my lab calls latent solutions. It doesn't matter what we call that,

462
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,609
you know, let's stick with this. Know how.

463
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,939
So we are not talking about this latent know-how,

464
00:24:57,949 --> 00:24:59,599
we are talking about super individual.

465
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,170
When I explain all that,

466
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,369
they give me answers such as

467
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,290
OK. But then for example, they would say,

468
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,189
for example, Chimpanzee nut

469
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:12,229
cracking would be uh one of these cases, right?

470
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:13,650
Chimpanzee nut cracking.

471
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:17,920
Um I don't need to explain, they use uh some hammers to crack, open some nuts,

472
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,369
you know, very cool behavior.

473
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,469
Nobody denies that.

474
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:24,729
But it's a question is that a good idea, you know, to call that super individual,

475
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:27,239
know how, in fact, um

476
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:32,589
this is so convincing to most people per se per se without

477
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:37,209
looking at the data that uh the United Nations have now uh

478
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:40,760
started to protect Chimpanzee nutcracker.

479
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:46,579
The United Nations protect Chimpanzee nut cracking. The whole idea there is

480
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,900
that this is

481
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,239
they don't use these terms.

482
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,310
But the whole idea is that this is so human like that, this is super individual.

483
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:57,380
Know how that this is not know how that the apes would ever show

484
00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:01,900
unless they had developed this culture around it. That's the idea, right?

485
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:05,180
And again, nobody is saying that this is a stupid idea.

486
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,780
You know, it's not a stupid idea.

487
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:10,140
It's just a matter of does it actually fit the data?

488
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,479
And so what we have done is we have

489
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:18,800
given um uh orangutans in two different zoos orangutans

490
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,079
untrained. So they were not trained to correct nuts,

491
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:25,500
un incarcerated, you know, so they were not,

492
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,199
their cognition wasn't changed by human interaction.

493
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,040
Maybe that's the shortest way I can describe this, you know,

494
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,310
they were left on their own

495
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:34,520
and

496
00:26:34,689 --> 00:26:37,349
nobody showed them how to correct these nuts,

497
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,469
right? We asked the keepers, they

498
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:43,609
promised us, you know that nobody showed them how to correct these nuts, right.

499
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,420
Well, they crack nuts, they use an animals and they crack nuts spontaneously,

500
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,890
right? So

501
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:54,060
orangutans don't even crack nuts in the wild.

502
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:58,199
This would have been maybe the last remaining

503
00:26:58,209 --> 00:27:01,469
uh rescue hypotheses for the United Nations.

504
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:08,319
Say when they say, oh, maybe they, they learned it somehow we, because eventually,

505
00:27:08,459 --> 00:27:10,160
if you go back long enough in time,

506
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,199
eventually some orangutans had to come from the wild,

507
00:27:12,209 --> 00:27:13,890
maybe they brought this knowledge along.

508
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,560
No, you know, orangutans don't crack nuts in the wild, not that we know of anyway.

509
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,599
And so we have basically um uh an ape species

510
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,270
very relevant because it's an ape species, you know,

511
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,390
they are all very closely related to each other and to us

512
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,319
um who didn't bring this knowledge from, there's no help from the world

513
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,760
who wasn't trained to show this knowledge,

514
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:40,510
who wasn't, you know, cognitively, um super enhanced by, by human incarceration.

515
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:43,959
And we didn't show them how to do these things and yet

516
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,520
they take hammers and they crack nuts, right?

517
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:48,530
So

518
00:27:48,969 --> 00:27:50,380
p definition is

519
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:53,339
this is not super individual. Nohow, by

520
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:57,290
definition, it shows that the individuals

521
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,329
could come up with this know-how.

522
00:28:00,339 --> 00:28:04,209
So this latent know-how, it's know how that they can come up with

523
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:05,439
on their own.

524
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:06,729
So exactly,

525
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:10,089
unlike the example that I said earlier when I said nobody wakes

526
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:13,209
up in the morning and just be able to speak Mandarin or,

527
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:13,780
or Portuguese

528
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,250
or, or whatever, you know,

529
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,770
that doesn't happen.

530
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,489
But in a is

531
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,680
it does happen that, you know, they, they encounter the situation

532
00:28:22,829 --> 00:28:24,810
and as long as they are motivated.

533
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:28,010
It's very important, motivated to actually eat these nuts.

534
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:28,910
We,

535
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,260
we tried this with chimpanzees as well and they were not motivated to eat the nuts.

536
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,630
And of course, you can't study it.

537
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:38,630
But you know, if they are motivated, then um apparently they can do it, you know,

538
00:28:39,109 --> 00:28:39,750
so

539
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:46,160
the answer then that people give you what is super individual, know how in the apes

540
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:49,339
you can then go and you test it in these ways.

541
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:52,060
And we have done many, many such tests.

542
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:55,920
And the overwhelming result from all these tests is

543
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:58,260
that people make these claims,

544
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,640
right? And the claim, nobody you know is fine to make this claim.

545
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,400
But then you test it

546
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:09,369
and we showed many of these papers are still yet to be published. You know, uh

547
00:29:09,569 --> 00:29:15,750
we show that these kind of know how develop spontaneously in individuals.

548
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,599
And therefore it does not require the special human skill,

549
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:22,680
it does not require the skill to copy.

550
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:27,119
This is very important, the skill to copy super individual know how

551
00:29:27,739 --> 00:29:33,790
instead all they need is uh being able to trigger each other's latent, know how

552
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:34,790
they do that.

553
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:36,510
But that's a different thing, right?

554
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,449
I can

555
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:42,390
this is a bad example because it's a hard wire behavior, but I can trigger you to yawn,

556
00:29:42,609 --> 00:29:46,469
you don't have to copy the know how of the yawn from me, right?

557
00:29:46,479 --> 00:29:47,859
Just to give you an example that

558
00:29:48,069 --> 00:29:49,989
it happens in humans too,

559
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,000
but it's very rare in the human case, right?

560
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:57,349
We don't, that's not usually the way that we work that we learn from each other.

561
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,310
Right? But it is a typical way

562
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:01,430
that the apes learn from each other. And,

563
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,310
you know, yes, they, they,

564
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:05,609
you have to have some social learning in the apes

565
00:30:05,619 --> 00:30:08,439
and it's clearly is there otherwise they wouldn't have culture.

566
00:30:08,449 --> 00:30:08,790
Right.

567
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:09,540
So,

568
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,989
um if you bring it all together apes have culture, yes,

569
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,589
but their culture is different in the sense that

570
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,910
they don't

571
00:30:17,219 --> 00:30:21,209
copy super individual, know how, which prevents logically,

572
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,630
which prevents the cultural evolution

573
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,160
of this. Know how,

574
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:27,500
because if the apes,

575
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,369
even if some ape comes up with a super great uh know how on their own.

576
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,630
Let's imagine an ape genius uh scenario. Let's just imagine this,

577
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,920
this a genius comes up with a super great super individual

578
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:39,839
or maybe a

579
00:30:39,959 --> 00:30:40,750
techni

580
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:45,780
technological way to crack nuts like 100 in an hour, you know, let's,

581
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,140
you know, we humans do this kind of thing. So why not? You know,

582
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:51,880
so um this a genius comes up with that,

583
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:54,969
but if the other apes are unable to copy super individual,

584
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:59,390
know how they are not in this example, they would not be geniuses.

585
00:30:59,540 --> 00:30:59,810
Well,

586
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:04,800
the predictable outcome would be that this invention would die with its maker.

587
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:05,569
You know,

588
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:10,630
all the others would do the kind of things that they are able to do on their own

589
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:15,569
again, a long answer. But, but that is maybe the shortest I can do for this question.

590
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,880
Great.

591
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:21,010
So uh before we move on to another topic, I mean,

592
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:26,060
the questions I have asked you up till now that were mostly related to

593
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:31,800
wild ape culture and how similar or different it is to human culture.

594
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:32,880
I mean,

595
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:33,969
of course,

596
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,280
uh intellectually

597
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,099
the I guess these questions are very interesting but

598
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,380
from the perspective of someone who's trying to study and understand

599
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,270
the culture, cultural evolution,

600
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,479
why should we bother with these questions?

601
00:31:51,489 --> 00:31:52,020
I mean, why,

602
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:57,839
why does it matter if wild ape culture is similar or different

603
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:02,209
to human culture and if similar or different in what way,

604
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:06,099
specifically, why should we bother with this question?

605
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:06,619
Um

606
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:08,660
So generally speaking, I think

607
00:32:09,199 --> 00:32:12,030
what we are doing in all these cases is

608
00:32:12,449 --> 00:32:13,199
we are not,

609
00:32:13,469 --> 00:32:16,500
we're not producing anything, you know, this is not,

610
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,689
you know, this is not feeding humans on the planet or the answer to this question,

611
00:32:21,699 --> 00:32:21,930
right?

612
00:32:21,939 --> 00:32:22,319
So

613
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,390
it's essential basic science,

614
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,729
essentially basic science, but that we are doing here,

615
00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:29,060
we're just trying to understand systems.

616
00:32:29,069 --> 00:32:30,329
That's, that's what we do.

617
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:31,079
And

618
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:33,449
within that, I think we have got

619
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,250
a couple of different approaches.

620
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,719
I am, I am a biologist by training originally. Now, I'm

621
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:42,260
also an archaeologist, but I am originally a biologist.

622
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,209
And so for me, it's just of general interest

623
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:51,089
to find out how apes behave and uh what ape culture is where it comes from and,

624
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,729
and so on and to describe it, you know, so that's

625
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,010
generally interesting,

626
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:59,849
but there are a couple of other things that are more broadly interesting. Um

627
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:05,699
So for example, to, to be able to talk about animal culture, generally,

628
00:33:05,709 --> 00:33:10,839
we would need to study as many animal species as possible.

629
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:14,150
Some people now even claim that plants have some social learning.

630
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,760
So we would have to include them

631
00:33:16,069 --> 00:33:19,140
in some general very general cultural category.

632
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:20,829
So

633
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:25,540
apes then would be one part of this general puzzle that we should study everything

634
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,550
that we can in an ideal world.

635
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,729
But in addition to that, um

636
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,170
we can use this kind of knowledge,

637
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,890
this hard gain knowledge in order to try to understand

638
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:40,420
um cultural settings generally and cultural evolution

639
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:45,790
generally and specifically for humans. And here is where the apes of course play

640
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,709
very

641
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:53,160
um large role. They play a large role because they are our closest living relatives.

642
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,180
And so in addition to being

643
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:57,530
of interest in and of themselves,

644
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,150
they are highly,

645
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:02,890
potentially highly uh phylogenetic informative.

646
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:09,530
Uh if we understand ape culture, it gives us a handle to have a likelihood,

647
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,409
understanding

648
00:34:10,708 --> 00:34:14,949
a likelihood, understanding of uh the last common ancestor

649
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,978
with apes.

650
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,530
So if we find some patterns that are shared among all living apes today,

651
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,800
chances are good. Chances are good is the implication

652
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:28,300
that the last common ancestor also shared in.

653
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,639
It's not the perfect uh uh data set, right.

654
00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:33,168
Ideally,

655
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:36,090
we would have to have hundreds of living ape species

656
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,458
that would be much better for this kind of influence.

657
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,340
But it's the best that we have,

658
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,469
you know, and, and so we should use it

659
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:48,120
and then we can infer with a certain likelihood what the last common ancestor

660
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,810
ancestors culture was like. And we can then build from that. And that is,

661
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:57,770
that is my other area of research. But I think we talked about that last time

662
00:34:57,899 --> 00:34:59,169
to a high uh

663
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:01,010
degree.

664
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:04,000
So I would be refer listeners interested in that

665
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:07,239
what we are homing in our own past ancestors,

666
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:11,399
cultures like and so on that we, that we debated last time.

667
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,959
So uh people could maybe listen to that then.

668
00:35:14,649 --> 00:35:15,439
Yes, of course.

669
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:16,840
And as I said, at the beginning,

670
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,580
I'm linking to our first interview in the description of this one.

671
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:25,780
And by the way, just to clarify when you mentioned that a certain point there,

672
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,929
our last common ancestor with apes.

673
00:35:28,939 --> 00:35:29,969
Are you referring

674
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:33,729
specifically to the last common ancestor?

675
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:34,439
We have,

676
00:35:34,449 --> 00:35:39,750
we have with chimpanzees or going all the way back to

677
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,389
the one from which uh orangutans and gorillas also wrenched.

678
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:49,370
I would, I would say the typical way that people talk about it,

679
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:52,139
the last common ancestor and they say it just like that

680
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,340
and it's the last common ancestor we have

681
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:56,530
together with the chimpanzees and the bonobos,

682
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:56,850
right?

683
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:57,889
Um

684
00:35:58,129 --> 00:35:58,689
But

685
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,370
my lab has also been, again, I would

686
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,810
refer to the last interview we did

687
00:36:03,989 --> 00:36:06,610
has also looked at all the other apes and so on so

688
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:06,860
forth.

689
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:11,760
We should really, ideally, we should look at all primates.

690
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:14,020
Uh But uh you know, that's hard to do.

691
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,580
It's, it's very difficult to get all the data for the apes.

692
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:20,050
So another question, then

693
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:26,669
there's this similarity hypothesis that people apply to the

694
00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:28,949
kinds of questions we've been talking about here.

695
00:36:28,959 --> 00:36:32,090
So what is the similarity hypothesis?

696
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:37,419
And what are the types of claims that people have proposed in favor of it?

697
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:38,699
I

698
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,419
think if you ask around us the conferences,

699
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:45,290
the the the the things that convinced most people

700
00:36:45,449 --> 00:36:47,540
sometime in their Androgyny, you know,

701
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:51,209
um many are convinced this is how I started too.

702
00:36:51,219 --> 00:36:54,760
I was convinced by the similarity of hypothesis in the beginning too.

703
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,949
And then the data changed my mind,

704
00:36:56,959 --> 00:37:00,979
my own data uh changed my mind but also other people's data.

705
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,610
Um

706
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,719
So many people arrived there because they had heard this

707
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:10,659
in school that all primates of human like culture,

708
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:14,060
sometimes this was just implicit by the teachers, you know,

709
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,540
and then people just pick it up in this way.

710
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:21,469
Sometimes it was said explicitly, I've asked some people a little bit about that,

711
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:26,340
but many also arrived because in public uh common media,

712
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:28,429
imagine Attenborough and so on.

713
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:32,909
But of course, other people in wildlife documentaries and so on, the typical way

714
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:36,330
that they describe these things is that they say, yeah, yeah,

715
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,070
this is all exactly like in the human case.

716
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,209
And then of course,

717
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:46,330
um, it looks also, I have to admit it looks at first it looks quite humanlike. Right.

718
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,780
Um, so why would people

719
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,100
based on that,

720
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:53,699
why would they come away watching these things and hearing these things?

721
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:56,219
Why would they come away with a skeptical mindset? Right.

722
00:37:56,229 --> 00:37:58,040
There's absolutely no reason for that.

723
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:04,110
But, and, and, and that's why I arrived at the scene, you know, uh like that, I,

724
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,479
I believed, you know, that apes would have human like culture.

725
00:38:08,709 --> 00:38:09,489
Um

726
00:38:10,379 --> 00:38:13,959
So, you know, if you look at that just superficially,

727
00:38:13,969 --> 00:38:18,570
there is something already wrong with this uh approach because when you look

728
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:23,139
even superficially at ape life and then human life even cross culturally,

729
00:38:23,379 --> 00:38:25,409
you do see differences, right? So

730
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,629
there is a problem if you think about it like that,

731
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:31,489
if you begin to actually compare with the human case, but let's not,

732
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,449
let's not go in this direction right now,

733
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,270
a different direction is to basically say

734
00:38:37,659 --> 00:38:41,239
what we, the the main convincing things are

735
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:47,030
that people see videos say of uh mother chimpanzee doing some things and then

736
00:38:47,419 --> 00:38:50,510
often cut videos, you know, sometimes not even the same individual,

737
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,090
but it can be the same individual

738
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,030
uh later on

739
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,590
these youngsters doing similar things,

740
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:57,620
all right.

741
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:03,229
Uh So that's very convincing to people, then I always point out

742
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:08,489
yes. But uh that is also the explanation that people had in the past

743
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,419
for um how birds learn to make their nests,

744
00:39:12,649 --> 00:39:17,169
they believe was that they always have to learn how to make their nest, how

745
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:18,320
notice how,

746
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:22,300
you know, they learn what material where this material is for sure.

747
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,360
But the how, that's the question and

748
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:27,719
uh the crucial uh studies there were done

749
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,199
uh many years ago,

750
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:29,649
Colas

751
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:30,129
and Colas,

752
00:39:30,459 --> 00:39:31,060
for example,

753
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,189
did a study on river bird nest making

754
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:35,764
weaver birds are fantastic because they super fantastic.

755
00:39:35,784 --> 00:39:37,514
N you know, super great design,

756
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:39,754
seemingly very complicated and so on.

757
00:39:39,764 --> 00:39:41,774
So what they did is they took an egg,

758
00:39:41,784 --> 00:39:44,475
the beauty with birds is that you can take them as an egg.

759
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:46,195
They can't have seen anything, right?

760
00:39:46,475 --> 00:39:50,735
And then they raised these eggs outside of the view of any nests,

761
00:39:50,745 --> 00:39:52,114
let alone nest making

762
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,360
and then they ate it, you know,

763
00:39:54,370 --> 00:40:00,229
and uh these river birds completely naive to nest and nest making,

764
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,300
they made the species typical nest

765
00:40:03,939 --> 00:40:07,199
and then, you know, people immediately get it, you know, they say,

766
00:40:07,469 --> 00:40:10,000
yeah, the, the logic is super clear here.

767
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:15,040
We may have assumed that the birds have to copy how to make the nests.

768
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:18,479
But these kind of studies conclusively prove

769
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,800
that they don't.

770
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:20,879
Hm.

771
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,520
And then I say, ok,

772
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,689
now we talked about uh birds somehow, you know,

773
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:29,810
birds are much less emotional and the logic is much clearer to see,

774
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:35,459
you know, let's go to this, unfortunately, very emotional case of the apes.

775
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,100
And what if I were to tell you that, you know, you see mother chimpanzee do something,

776
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:45,360
uh baby chimpanzee do something if we now remove this knowledge, right?

777
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:46,620
And they still do it.

778
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:50,949
And I, I told you about this one example in the orangutan case already, you know,

779
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:53,010
they didn't have to see these kind of things.

780
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:56,100
It's logically, it's the same structure

781
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:57,020
in the river

782
00:40:57,129 --> 00:41:00,110
bird case as in the orangutan nut cracking case,

783
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,909
if they can do these things on their own,

784
00:41:03,189 --> 00:41:07,360
it proves that the assumption that they have to copy these things

785
00:41:07,669 --> 00:41:08,939
was wrong, right?

786
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:10,909
Um So that's,

787
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:14,010
that's essentially one aspect. But there are,

788
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,429
there are two more I think.

789
00:41:15,889 --> 00:41:20,290
Um another is that people point to uh

790
00:41:21,149 --> 00:41:23,629
to super rare behaviors.

791
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:27,209
Uh And they say, look, you know, this is similar to the human case.

792
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:31,750
We've got this super rare behaviors only occurs here only occurs here

793
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,350
in this particular population of say chimpanzees.

794
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,540
And again, the intuition, we can,

795
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,520
we can long discuss why that is the case.

796
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:43,050
But I don't need to because people have this intuition already.

797
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,080
So I don't need to explain why that is actually not a bad argument per se.

798
00:41:47,669 --> 00:41:49,360
Um But then we tested that.

799
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,659
So um I A

800
00:41:51,139 --> 00:41:51,179
Motes

801
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:53,659
Rodrigo, my, my phd student at the time and I,

802
00:41:53,669 --> 00:41:57,800
we tested that and we looked at all these claims where people have said

803
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,209
this kind of know how only exists in this

804
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:05,209
one population of one specific um species of apes

805
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,229
and we asked around and we look for the literature that came later.

806
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,209
Uh if that is actually the case

807
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:14,620
and we found that in 99% of cases

808
00:42:14,889 --> 00:42:18,709
that was not the case or 98% you know, was not the case.

809
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:21,449
Instead these things did repeat

810
00:42:21,919 --> 00:42:22,969
someplace else.

811
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:26,280
They, they, they, that shows that this intuition,

812
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,889
even though it was not a bad intuition,

813
00:42:28,419 --> 00:42:29,070
you know,

814
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:33,929
it was actually not correct in, in the vast majority of cases,

815
00:42:34,379 --> 00:42:34,719
a

816
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,199
know how repeats

817
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,879
across different things. It pops up time and again.

818
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:42,540
And then you have to explain why does it pop up time and again.

819
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,560
And our approach is to say, well, because it is latently present

820
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,179
anyway, right? And it requires certain conditions,

821
00:42:50,782 --> 00:42:55,042
um motivational issues, environmental conditions, et cetera, et cetera,

822
00:42:55,052 --> 00:43:01,143
tiny details to then create different patches of these cultures everywhere.

823
00:43:01,262 --> 00:43:02,502
That's cultural.

824
00:43:02,512 --> 00:43:04,722
Let's let's be very clear about this,

825
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:07,212
but it's different cultural from the human case because we

826
00:43:07,222 --> 00:43:10,802
culturally evolve our know how on top of this,

827
00:43:10,812 --> 00:43:12,212
you know, very different uh approach.

828
00:43:12,825 --> 00:43:17,845
Oh yeah. And uh and lastly, I think what many people are also convinced of is

829
00:43:18,016 --> 00:43:22,926
when they see, for example, let's say uh in a Hollywood movie these days,

830
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:26,345
luckily Hollywood does a lot of CG I for apes and so on.

831
00:43:26,355 --> 00:43:27,355
But in the past,

832
00:43:27,365 --> 00:43:31,885
they would have a trained ape and that ape would act say very human like, right?

833
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:33,055
And then they,

834
00:43:33,476 --> 00:43:34,166
this

835
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:37,340
the number of people who

836
00:43:37,479 --> 00:43:41,110
came to this belief because of these kind of images

837
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:46,340
goes down, I think, but they still exist. And so they basically then say,

838
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:51,870
uh look, I've seen apes act like humans. What are you, what are you talking about?

839
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:55,620
Claudio, I've seen apes look like humans and act like humans.

840
00:43:55,629 --> 00:43:57,820
So they must have copied it from humans.

841
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,000
And that is not true. We can,

842
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:04,689
we can make a bear ride a motorcycle in circles.

843
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:06,600
It's not that I would do this, but we can.

844
00:44:06,919 --> 00:44:12,610
But that doesn't mean that why natural bears ride motorcycles, right?

845
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:16,110
So we have to keep separate, trained behavior

846
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:21,739
and going even further, we have to keep separate and incarcerated apes that

847
00:44:21,889 --> 00:44:25,360
you know, that are very special, incarcerated apes are a special case.

848
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:29,169
They are again irrelevant for the aggression of wild ape cultures.

849
00:44:29,399 --> 00:44:33,379
But it's much harder to see why they are irrelevant for this case.

850
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:38,530
But uh why should we study un

851
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:45,520
-- inculturated and untrained apes? What kind of information can we get from
-- them?

852
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:47,550
So the again, the trained,

853
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,429
the trained apes, if we,

854
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:52,239
if we were to train a dog,

855
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:57,209
say, uh if we were to train a dog to not like meat,

856
00:44:57,399 --> 00:44:59,679
let's just make it very simple.

857
00:44:59,689 --> 00:45:02,939
It's not about know how this is about, know what, know what to eat,

858
00:45:03,229 --> 00:45:04,770
but it doesn't matter for now,

859
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:10,040
then it's very easy to see that this is not representative anymore

860
00:45:10,389 --> 00:45:11,590
for wolves.

861
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:16,020
Why would wolves not like me, right.

862
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:17,590
So if you were to take,

863
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:20,929
of course, dogs are uh domesticated animals,

864
00:45:20,939 --> 00:45:23,840
we can use a non-domestic animal with a similar logic.

865
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,620
It's easy enough to do. So let's just stick with the dogs.

866
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:27,669
Um

867
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:32,149
So if we were to make them train them not to do something,

868
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,110
we can do that, right?

869
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:38,000
Uh But that is not um relevant for

870
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,870
extrapolating

871
00:45:40,219 --> 00:45:42,719
what wild animals would be doing.

872
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,270
This is just one example, but they, the one generalizes,

873
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,409
we can train

874
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:51,050
animals generally via clicker training.

875
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:54,129
I've done this myself, you know, uh all kinds of race.

876
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,790
Um We can do that

877
00:45:55,899 --> 00:46:00,370
and they perform things including even if we want to know how

878
00:46:00,669 --> 00:46:02,379
we can make a dog done salsa,

879
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:02,959
right?

880
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:06,899
Uh We can do, we can install, know how in them

881
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,939
that would never come about

882
00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,399
in wild animals.

883
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,820
That means that we need to exclude

884
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:19,179
all of these cases where we train the, know how into these animals.

885
00:46:19,189 --> 00:46:22,540
Because the question is not, is decidedly not,

886
00:46:22,929 --> 00:46:23,729
can

887
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:29,780
for example, an ape, can an ape, can an ape show some human know how

888
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,350
that question is a different question,

889
00:46:32,429 --> 00:46:37,260
that question we can answer yes because for example, we can train them to

890
00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:40,949
our question here is different. Our question is

891
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,649
can a spontaneously copy

892
00:46:44,899 --> 00:46:46,510
super individual nohow,

893
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:47,939
copy

894
00:46:48,229 --> 00:46:50,929
and spontaneous, you know, these, these are the two

895
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:55,550
things that we have to have in place because if they are not spontaneous.

896
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,800
Um And if it's not copying, then this is not what we are really after.

897
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:00,489
You know, that's,

898
00:47:00,699 --> 00:47:02,110
that's what we are after here.

899
00:47:02,770 --> 00:47:03,489
Oh, yeah. And

900
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:06,719
with the incarceration, the incarceration is a little bit complicated.

901
00:47:06,729 --> 00:47:08,489
So bear with me a little bit.

902
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:09,199
Ok.

903
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:10,560
Um

904
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:13,169
There are two

905
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:17,270
general, two general approaches to explaining why

906
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,570
we humans have special social learning abilities.

907
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:22,929
So

908
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,939
just so, you know, yes, I'm,

909
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:28,409
my research group is a little bit special that we talk about,

910
00:47:28,419 --> 00:47:30,949
know how copying supervision, know how copying.

911
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:32,500
So we specify it like that.

912
00:47:32,669 --> 00:47:34,770
But we are by no means alone

913
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:39,149
in saying that humans have some special social learning abilities.

914
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:40,510
Others focus

915
00:47:40,629 --> 00:47:43,550
focus much more detailed on imitation and so on.

916
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,750
We think this is too, too focused, you know, but it doesn't matter.

917
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,889
So we are not the only ones that

918
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:50,969
say humans have got special social learning abilities,

919
00:47:50,979 --> 00:47:51,679
good.

920
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:53,310
Keep that in mind. So now

921
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:57,189
when we say there was a whole class of social learning American

922
00:47:57,330 --> 00:48:00,370
that's special. Let's even not say what they are.

923
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:04,360
Then there are two general approaches to this,

924
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:08,199
how we humans got to have these special social learning.

925
00:48:08,449 --> 00:48:11,000
One approach is to say

926
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:13,800
they are adaptations, they are natural adaptations.

927
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:16,139
We have them in our genes essentially.

928
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,800
Again, I'm painting with a very broad product.

929
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:22,610
These people will then say, well, we are born

930
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:25,570
with these skills or we are born

931
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:33,080
um in a way that makes us have these skills very, very, very likely, you know,

932
00:48:33,939 --> 00:48:37,040
OK, again, broad brush, let's not go into detail

933
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:38,189
uh here.

934
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:41,199
But there was this other approach where people say

935
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:43,649
yes, genes play a little bit of a role,

936
00:48:43,659 --> 00:48:46,939
but they play only a small role and they play an enabling role.

937
00:48:47,179 --> 00:48:47,550
They pro

938
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:49,800
provide a small platform

939
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:55,020
on which we build these skills and the skills themselves, these special skills,

940
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,520
they are built into us

941
00:48:58,030 --> 00:48:59,000
socially.

942
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,870
They are built into us by culture itself.

943
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:06,939
Very unintrusive idea. Basically what these people say

944
00:49:07,959 --> 00:49:11,639
at the forefront of this old movement right now is uh Cecilia Hayes.

945
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,320
What these people are saying is

946
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:16,830
we culturally learn

947
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,479
how to culturally learn.

948
00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:20,719
OK.

949
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:24,419
So why am I, why am I mentioning this? You will know this anyway, but

950
00:49:24,919 --> 00:49:27,399
I'm mentioning this because if that is true,

951
00:49:27,409 --> 00:49:29,919
let's just assume for this moment that this is true.

952
00:49:29,929 --> 00:49:31,649
This is the correct way. Let's just assume

953
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,290
then

954
00:49:34,419 --> 00:49:37,989
humans themselves learn these things culturally.

955
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:43,830
And if we learn this thing culturally, it stands to reason that perhaps

956
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:48,639
the ways in which we transmit these skills, we could

957
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:51,169
apply these skills

958
00:49:51,729 --> 00:49:53,810
and make other species

959
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,169
have these skills too

960
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:59,889
that we can find soft means to

961
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,370
install

962
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,810
again, broad brush, install in their brains,

963
00:50:05,129 --> 00:50:07,330
completely new skills, new abilities,

964
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:11,090
including new abilities to culturally learn.

965
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,169
Uh

966
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,530
And indeed, it seems to be,

967
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:19,489
you know, this does not mean that this whole approach of the CD A is is

968
00:50:19,689 --> 00:50:23,290
completely correct. Although these days, I tend to believe that

969
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:25,030
maybe it is right,

970
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:30,110
but it certainly is in favor of this approach that we see that if we train,

971
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,389
if we put our minds to it, if we put our intentions behind it,

972
00:50:33,399 --> 00:50:35,209
if we apply everything that we can

973
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:39,169
to make apes copy, nohow,

974
00:50:39,929 --> 00:50:41,000
we succeeded.

975
00:50:41,729 --> 00:50:44,429
We can, we can make them

976
00:50:44,669 --> 00:50:48,770
different apes, we can change them, we can cognitively change them.

977
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,110
We install something new

978
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:52,149
in their brains

979
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:55,510
that they wouldn't otherwise have. That's the other implication.

980
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:59,159
And that is what happens intentionally or not.

981
00:50:59,169 --> 00:51:02,899
You know, it depends on the study uh when we incarcerate

982
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:03,760
apes.

983
00:51:04,669 --> 00:51:05,310
Now,

984
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,760
that means then

985
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,439
because no ape is running around in the wild

986
00:51:11,449 --> 00:51:13,350
and no human is running around in the wild,

987
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,760
inculturated apes.

988
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,610
And this is not the case now and this hasn't been

989
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:22,330
the case in any time in the evolutionary past of apes

990
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,250
that we need to exclude.

991
00:51:25,689 --> 00:51:30,429
This is just very, very simple logic. We need to exclude this incarcerated apes

992
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:32,149
um from our equation.

993
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:33,790
They

994
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:36,409
cannot provide the answer. They are interesting

995
00:51:36,649 --> 00:51:39,479
if you want to study the whole approach of C VA and so on.

996
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:42,850
They're very interesting, you know, for these other reasons. But

997
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:47,300
if we want to understand what, why apes have and what, you know,

998
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,510
how they make their cultures

999
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,084
and by implication, what our last common answer that

1000
00:51:52,195 --> 00:51:52,245
uh

1001
00:51:52,725 --> 00:51:54,304
we must fully exclude

1002
00:51:54,554 --> 00:51:56,985
uh incarcerated apes. That's why I

1003
00:51:57,125 --> 00:52:02,094
whenever I absolutely can. I try not to study incarcerated apes. You know,

1004
00:52:02,304 --> 00:52:06,445
the only time when we do is if they are intermixed with un incarcerated apes

1005
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:11,175
and then we hope that the un incarcerated apes come first and test first. You know,

1006
00:52:11,334 --> 00:52:12,705
then it's interpretable.

1007
00:52:12,715 --> 00:52:16,425
If the incarcerated apes do it first, then it's uninterpretable.

1008
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:18,280
Ok.

1009
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:21,350
So, uh I mean, I wasn't planning on asking you about this,

1010
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:26,370
but since you mentioned Cecilia Hayes there, I've had an interview with her

1011
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:31,979
in 2019. And so I, I can't really avoid asking you this now. So

1012
00:52:32,169 --> 00:52:35,175
uh I would like to ask you more about

1013
00:52:35,544 --> 00:52:38,415
what do you think about her

1014
00:52:38,544 --> 00:52:41,854
approach to culture? I mean, to what extent,

1015
00:52:42,195 --> 00:52:44,205
but at this point in time,

1016
00:52:44,215 --> 00:52:49,435
would you agree or disagree with her proposals and her claims?

1017
00:52:49,445 --> 00:52:50,185
And

1018
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:55,860
if she, if she was correct, what do you think would be

1019
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:01,439
the implications in terms of how we approach culture

1020
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:02,429
from

1021
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:04,330
an evolutionary sl

1022
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:11,179
slash phylogenetic perspective? Because I mean, wouldn't that change the game

1023
00:53:11,409 --> 00:53:15,780
uh to some extent because there, there, there are people.

1024
00:53:15,873 --> 00:53:18,792
Uh I, I mean, and I'm not saying they are wrong but

1025
00:53:18,972 --> 00:53:20,693
uh when it comes to

1026
00:53:20,893 --> 00:53:26,212
how culture evolved, uh they tend to think about particular

1027
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:31,822
uh cognitive mechanisms as having to be set in place

1028
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,893
in a particular species for it to be able to

1029
00:53:35,282 --> 00:53:39,702
either uh have culture entirely or not,

1030
00:53:39,873 --> 00:53:44,766
or to be able to have specific kinds

1031
00:53:44,775 --> 00:53:49,345
of culture or cultural manifestations like language,

1032
00:53:49,355 --> 00:53:50,525
for example, right?

1033
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:55,466
Uh But I, but I mean, I, if she was correct,

1034
00:53:55,605 --> 00:54:01,206
wouldn't that have a big impact on how we think about culture,

1035
00:54:01,216 --> 00:54:04,355
particularly from a biological perspective?

1036
00:54:04,625 --> 00:54:06,156
Several people in the past,

1037
00:54:06,669 --> 00:54:11,090
I had proposed that this whole idea of having all these modules in the brain

1038
00:54:11,419 --> 00:54:12,040
uh

1039
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:14,610
being evolved separately and so on, it,

1040
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,729
it doesn't really work because we don't have,

1041
00:54:17,739 --> 00:54:22,320
this is actually an argument made by Mike to Marcelo in his 99 book,

1042
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:25,209
The Cultural Origins of Human Cognition.

1043
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:30,770
So Mike went a long way in a similar direction as as Hayes,

1044
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:35,679
but he actually stopped short only of uh for a few stops, let's say,

1045
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:39,929
um he said his argument was we don't have much time,

1046
00:54:40,219 --> 00:54:43,760
uh evolutionarily speaking, if we look at archaeology and so on

1047
00:54:43,899 --> 00:54:49,860
uh to explain the human condition. And so this is just not very convincing

1048
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:54,260
that we would have enough time to have all these modules installed in our brain.

1049
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,209
There are the reasons why

1050
00:54:56,739 --> 00:54:59,060
this was always a little bit dubious

1051
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:05,600
and Hayes just, just, I mean, she did a wonderful job, she went some steps further

1052
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,070
and she said, OK,

1053
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:12,939
uh where Mike said, we have some adaptations such as he focused on imitation,

1054
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:15,310
a sub form of, of know how copying fine

1055
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:17,659
uh general perfect direction.

1056
00:55:17,919 --> 00:55:18,540
Um

1057
00:55:19,409 --> 00:55:20,040
uh Haman

1058
00:55:20,439 --> 00:55:21,409
said, even that

1059
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,709
even that has a cultural origin, right?

1060
00:55:25,149 --> 00:55:25,989
Uh And,

1061
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:30,030
and in her book, and in her B BS paper and so on.

1062
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:31,429
She listed

1063
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:33,489
quite convincing

1064
00:55:33,649 --> 00:55:37,790
data sets and I'm sure you talked about that in the interview.

1065
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,550
It's quite convincing the case that the

1066
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,889
cultural learning of cultural learning is the thing

1067
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,030
in humans.

1068
00:55:45,419 --> 00:55:49,719
But for my own approach, just because this is important for, for, for me here as well.

1069
00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:51,959
For my own approach, it doesn't really matter

1070
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,340
if there's no how copy this super individual,

1071
00:55:55,350 --> 00:56:00,060
know how copying if we humans get the genetically broadly speaking

1072
00:56:00,189 --> 00:56:01,639
or culturally,

1073
00:56:02,489 --> 00:56:04,760
as long as we have it,

1074
00:56:05,469 --> 00:56:07,770
right? So my approach is mute

1075
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,729
on where it came from

1076
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,689
it. I'm not saying it doesn't matter, but it's

1077
00:56:14,449 --> 00:56:17,389
for all current purposes is mute on where it came from.

1078
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:18,600
Um

1079
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:22,360
uh As long as it's there and as long it is

1080
00:56:22,370 --> 00:56:26,679
as it is uh meaningfully link to all these phenomenon here.

1081
00:56:26,689 --> 00:56:27,679
And I think it is

1082
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:32,280
uh then um you know, that that approach still works

1083
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:34,199
because in either case,

1084
00:56:34,899 --> 00:56:38,080
I would say in either case, you have this missing

1085
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:38,679
in the,

1086
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,800
you don't really see the

1087
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,899
signature signal

1088
00:56:44,449 --> 00:56:48,439
that super individual know how copying would have led to

1089
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,479
in wild a culture,

1090
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:52,820
right? And we don't see super

1091
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:55,580
individual know how copying spontaneously either.

1092
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,399
So

1093
00:56:56,929 --> 00:57:01,699
putting it all together, you know, it doesn't matter where we humans have it from

1094
00:57:02,139 --> 00:57:07,340
what seems to be a factor that apes don't have it at all or

1095
00:57:07,639 --> 00:57:11,679
they have it to such a low degree or so or show it so rarely

1096
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:14,729
that it really doesn't translate in special types of

1097
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:17,510
culture that would be similar to the human spec

1098
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:20,054
type of culture that we have here, right?

1099
00:57:20,264 --> 00:57:20,895
Um

1100
00:57:21,014 --> 00:57:26,435
I should also say that maybe there are other species that can copy super individual,

1101
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:29,854
know how you know in some domains, some people talk about whale

1102
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:33,885
song copying, you know, in a super individual area, there is

1103
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:35,985
there was some debate around that too.

1104
00:57:36,104 --> 00:57:39,495
But be that as it may here, we are talking about the apes,

1105
00:57:39,715 --> 00:57:42,165
right? And they are the phylogenetic

1106
00:57:42,284 --> 00:57:44,175
uh meaningful comparison.

1107
00:57:44,429 --> 00:57:49,530
And whenever we looked, uh we could not find these kind of things in the apes.

1108
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:49,790
OK.

1109
00:57:50,169 --> 00:57:56,209
So um let me ask you now about uh another kind of questions. So

1110
00:57:56,489 --> 00:58:00,159
uh we've already mentioned a few times during the interview

1111
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:06,110
uh social learning. So and of course to study ape social learning,

1112
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:11,719
people use different kinds of tasks. And the question I would like to ask you is

1113
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:16,610
do you think that the tasks that are commonly used to study ape,

1114
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:18,889
social learning are suitable?

1115
00:58:20,489 --> 00:58:23,250
Yes. Yeah, I mean suitable for what? Right.

1116
00:58:24,179 --> 00:58:26,500
I have to be quite blunt here.

1117
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:27,719
Um

1118
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:30,429
My blunt reaction would be to say

1119
00:58:32,669 --> 00:58:36,050
they are claimed to be suitable for certain purposes,

1120
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,750
the kind of purposes that we talk about today in this interview.

1121
00:58:39,899 --> 00:58:41,739
And I think for that purpose,

1122
00:58:41,979 --> 00:58:43,320
they prove to be

1123
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,260
unsuitable.

1124
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:49,989
Um Let me, let me explain a little bit. The main task that is being used.

1125
00:58:50,939 --> 00:58:56,659
Um The main task that is being used is the so called um, two target task.

1126
00:58:57,189 --> 00:58:59,780
It's essentially a task you can imagine.

1127
00:58:59,959 --> 00:59:03,919
Uh if, if we have a box here and this is a box here and then there is a,

1128
00:59:03,929 --> 00:59:06,620
there is a door and the door can be pulled open,

1129
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,780
it can be pushed

1130
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,419
over, right. So you push it, you get the food inside, you pull it, you get the

1131
00:59:12,409 --> 00:59:16,550
and then one group of Apes sees the the pushing, you know,

1132
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,750
another group of Apes sees the pulling

1133
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:20,820
and then people say,

1134
00:59:21,550 --> 00:59:25,449
uh oh, and the result is frequently, not always, but frequently.

1135
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:26,229
Yes.

1136
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:28,370
The ones that saw the pushing, they,

1137
00:59:28,379 --> 00:59:32,610
they do the pushing and the ones that saw the pulling, they do the pulling good.

1138
00:59:33,629 --> 00:59:36,689
And but, but then on this level, there is no disagreement.

1139
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:40,639
I've done these tasks myself. And, you know, sometimes I find I found this too.

1140
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,729
So the phenomenon is not a question,

1141
00:59:43,429 --> 00:59:44,399
the interpretation

1142
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:49,159
and the interpretation is that some people, first of all, they then claimed

1143
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:53,489
we are looking at action, copy, at the behavior copy.

1144
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:56,909
But that can't be true because for example, here, you know,

1145
00:59:56,919 --> 01:00:01,290
I can make it so that you don't even see my actions and these things move.

1146
01:00:01,409 --> 01:00:05,330
In fact, that was a point that Celia Hayes made in, I think in the nineties.

1147
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:08,030
But apart even from that,

1148
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:11,429
apart, even from that, there is a bigger problem here.

1149
01:00:11,719 --> 01:00:14,389
The bigger problem is that people then thought

1150
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,229
doing these tasks.

1151
01:00:16,469 --> 01:00:19,679
Um we find special types of learning,

1152
01:00:19,689 --> 01:00:23,270
special types of learning that we only find in the human case.

1153
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,629
And that explain all of the human culture here.

1154
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,760
Now, that's a huge problem because

1155
01:00:29,169 --> 01:00:35,840
it turns out that not just humans and not just apes copy in these tasks,

1156
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:38,800
dogs copy in these tasks.

1157
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:42,459
OK? Then you might say dogs are domesticated and so on, you know,

1158
01:00:42,669 --> 01:00:47,979
but recently, uh also reptiles copy in these tasks, right?

1159
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:53,060
So if you want to take this task performance and these two target tasks

1160
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,030
as a special way of learning,

1161
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:59,879
you have got a problem because then you would expect reptiles.

1162
01:00:59,969 --> 01:01:02,780
I have nothing against reptiles, you know, but you don't just see it, you,

1163
01:01:02,790 --> 01:01:03,739
you don't see it,

1164
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:06,780
then you would expect reptiles to have humanlike culture too.

1165
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,389
That really is the key.

1166
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,179
That is the first hint that,

1167
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:14,310
you know, we have been barking up the wrong tree with these tasks. I can say that

1168
01:01:14,419 --> 01:01:18,360
because I've done these tasks myself, right? So I think it's, it's fair if I,

1169
01:01:18,489 --> 01:01:23,530
if I say this done this task myself and I think we, we have, we have been doing

1170
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:24,889
the wrong thing there.

1171
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:29,810
The other big big clue is the empirical finding that

1172
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:33,860
if you look whether the apes, in this case, the apes,

1173
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:39,060
if they can pull the door open on their own without having seen it pulled open

1174
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:44,860
or if they can push the door open without having seen the door being pushed open,

1175
01:01:45,489 --> 01:01:49,310
not just the door of the board removal, leber movements.

1176
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:52,320
You know, there are different versions of these cars. In all cases.

1177
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:53,709
We've done a review on that

1178
01:01:53,949 --> 01:01:55,919
together with Lydia Hopper and Carl Von

1179
01:01:56,139 --> 01:01:58,790
SYK. Um, we've done a review and we found,

1180
01:01:59,419 --> 01:02:00,510
well, actually,

1181
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,020
uh as you might imagine because they don't sound very difficult these tasks,

1182
01:02:05,149 --> 01:02:10,429
actually, the apes can just solve these tasks in all of these ways on their own.

1183
01:02:10,709 --> 01:02:14,330
This is of importance for the current interview as well because

1184
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:21,600
as I said earlier, we what we need to find is know how copying that is the copying of,

1185
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:23,479
know how that is super individual.

1186
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:27,449
So we are back to the same kind of um learning

1187
01:02:28,185 --> 01:02:30,495
in these cases that we already talked about

1188
01:02:30,504 --> 01:02:33,155
when we talked about the orangutan not cracking.

1189
01:02:33,165 --> 01:02:36,955
If you can potentially develop this, know how on your own.

1190
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:37,625
Anyway,

1191
01:02:37,635 --> 01:02:40,534
then all you need is know how triggering you need

1192
01:02:40,544 --> 01:02:44,274
triggering of know how that is latently already there.

1193
01:02:44,695 --> 01:02:50,024
That's very different from copying, know how that you could not produce on your own.

1194
01:02:50,195 --> 01:02:54,895
So for this reason, these two target tasks and there are many, many of them and so on,

1195
01:02:54,905 --> 01:02:55,334
you know,

1196
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,530
for this purpose,

1197
01:02:57,879 --> 01:02:59,699
they, they just don't work,

1198
01:02:59,969 --> 01:03:01,659
they work for other purposes.

1199
01:03:01,850 --> 01:03:05,110
Uh People are very interested in so-called social learning biases

1200
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,850
and so on this is like the traffic lights for,

1201
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,520
for social learning under which circumstance to your social learning.

1202
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:11,310
That's fine.

1203
01:03:11,699 --> 01:03:14,370
Absolutely. You can use these tasks for that. You know,

1204
01:03:14,475 --> 01:03:19,195
there is very nice uh papers by Rachel Candle and others and so on. Very nice.

1205
01:03:19,205 --> 01:03:19,895
You can do that.

1206
01:03:20,104 --> 01:03:23,435
But for the current purpose, you know, human like culture and so on,

1207
01:03:23,705 --> 01:03:26,465
um it turned out empirically, you cannot, you know,

1208
01:03:26,754 --> 01:03:30,375
uh you can design maybe better tasks uh that, that,

1209
01:03:30,514 --> 01:03:33,094
you know, the the animals cannot solve on their own.

1210
01:03:33,395 --> 01:03:35,445
Um But you would have to make sure

1211
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:38,054
in these tasks that they are about, know how

1212
01:03:38,439 --> 01:03:41,189
not about no, where, no, what and so on.

1213
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,120
So

1214
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:45,770
again, as always, the devil is in the detail. I told you at the very beginning,

1215
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:48,669
culture is a slippery concept and it becomes

1216
01:03:48,679 --> 01:03:51,139
even more slippery when you make these distinctions.

1217
01:03:51,149 --> 01:03:54,020
But I would argue we have to make these distinctions

1218
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,909
otherwise we don't get it, you know,

1219
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:58,139
the distinctions between human and ape culture.

1220
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:02,270
And so what would be in your opinion,

1221
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:07,189
suitable tasks to studying ape social learning?

1222
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:08,729
Yes. So

1223
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:10,989
this task exists.

1224
01:04:11,479 --> 01:04:12,389
Um

1225
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:18,379
The first was done by uh by a consortium of, of researchers. Um Michael Marcelo

1226
01:04:18,629 --> 01:04:20,649
was there, Joseph Cole was there as well.

1227
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,310
And what they did is they

1228
01:04:22,419 --> 01:04:25,429
essentially they um made some chimpanzees

1229
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,229
learn new begging gestures.

1230
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:29,300
Mhm

1231
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:35,689
Translated into this interview in, in uh one would say they taught, they taught,

1232
01:04:35,699 --> 01:04:36,750
they trained them,

1233
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:40,770
they trained them, you know, this is not to be confused with copying these,

1234
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:43,280
these animals didn't copy Mike and just happen.

1235
01:04:43,290 --> 01:04:44,090
And the others, you know,

1236
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:48,050
they train these animals to show, you know how

1237
01:04:48,379 --> 01:04:51,159
to beg from humans, know how good.

1238
01:04:51,709 --> 01:04:58,250
And uh and then uh I think 18 observer chimpanzees saw this new, know how

1239
01:04:58,449 --> 01:05:00,500
be being used as a begging gesture,

1240
01:05:00,959 --> 01:05:01,409
you know,

1241
01:05:01,489 --> 01:05:05,610
and what happened is uh these uh these observers saw it and

1242
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:09,780
every time this uh train chimpanzees would use this new begging gesture,

1243
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:10,850
they would get food.

1244
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:12,760
It was a perfect begging gesture, you know,

1245
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:14,840
from the perspective of these observers.

1246
01:05:15,129 --> 01:05:20,590
Now, did any of these observers copy this new know-how, including I think one son

1247
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,010
of one of the demonstrators, you know, so it's,

1248
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:26,310
it's exactly this mother uh kid relationship that

1249
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,590
we always see uh in these wild shows,

1250
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:28,989
you know,

1251
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,030
no,

1252
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:34,870
not a single one of them copied uh any of these know hows, right? So

1253
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:36,659
these, these are suitable,

1254
01:05:36,945 --> 01:05:40,985
you make them ideally, you make it so that you've got a large baseline.

1255
01:05:40,995 --> 01:05:44,294
You, you check really if they show any of this uh no

1256
01:05:44,485 --> 01:05:44,504
how

1257
01:05:44,854 --> 01:05:46,685
on their own spontaneously.

1258
01:05:47,054 --> 01:05:52,004
And then if they don't, you train them to show that and you show this to others.

1259
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:54,485
And I myself have because I always thought this

1260
01:05:54,495 --> 01:05:56,495
is exactly the kind of study that we need.

1261
01:05:56,504 --> 01:05:58,284
This is the gold standard study.

1262
01:05:58,544 --> 01:06:01,925
So my group uh we have done a couple of these studies

1263
01:06:02,135 --> 01:06:05,205
and overall, I think we have now tested,

1264
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:11,739
I, I wanna say over 100 apes different species, you know, all general actually.

1265
01:06:12,389 --> 01:06:17,929
And um in no cases, in no cases, did we find any time

1266
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:20,360
any super individual know I copy?

1267
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:22,780
This is very strong evidence

1268
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:25,810
that our hypotheses that we held

1269
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:28,110
uh was always correct. Right.

1270
01:06:28,149 --> 01:06:32,639
Um Or let me, let me, let me put it so that it's easier digestible.

1271
01:06:32,649 --> 01:06:34,570
Maybe for, for those still skeptical,

1272
01:06:35,409 --> 01:06:39,820
given that we tested, I think over 100 chimpanzees uh oh no,

1273
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:41,879
over 100 apes of different general

1274
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:45,889
and that none of them ever copied super individual

1275
01:06:45,899 --> 01:06:49,969
know how in a technical domain in a non-technical domain

1276
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:50,669
uh from,

1277
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:55,590
from aid demonstrators from human demonstrators and majority conditions.

1278
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,530
So several showed them, you know,

1279
01:06:57,719 --> 01:06:59,510
uh in all kinds of ways.

1280
01:07:00,290 --> 01:07:04,070
And given that we never found any super individual know our copying,

1281
01:07:04,469 --> 01:07:07,449
not it, it supports the view that if

1282
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,239
apes have supervision or

1283
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:10,889
copy

1284
01:07:11,439 --> 01:07:14,330
they applied either super rarely,

1285
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:15,510
right?

1286
01:07:15,709 --> 01:07:17,629
Or are very weakly.

1287
01:07:18,189 --> 01:07:21,159
This is of high importance because all the cultural

1288
01:07:21,169 --> 01:07:25,350
evolution models show that you need a certain threshold level

1289
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:27,550
of both the frequency,

1290
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:32,030
the reliability of the social learning and the strength of this social learning.

1291
01:07:32,739 --> 01:07:36,330
So said in this way, even if they sometimes very rarely do this,

1292
01:07:36,689 --> 01:07:38,169
it just wouldn't be enough

1293
01:07:38,689 --> 01:07:41,489
to have them have this kind of human culture

1294
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:44,350
that we humans have right. So that is,

1295
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:45,010
that is,

1296
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,500
I think a strong statement that we can make with

1297
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:50,330
the data that we have at hand right now.

1298
01:07:51,929 --> 01:07:53,300
OK. And so

1299
01:07:53,780 --> 01:08:00,840
what can we tell from those data then? Because I would imagine that

1300
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:08,100
uh one claim that someone could make, could make is something like, OK. So then

1301
01:08:08,989 --> 01:08:11,209
does this all mean that

1302
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:17,430
uh apes do not socially learn and they do not

1303
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:24,009
and cannot have culture? I mean, I is that a plausible claim to make

1304
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:27,129
it is not a plausible claim? I have said

1305
01:08:27,229 --> 01:08:33,009
extremely explicitly. I think in the last uh paper uh I said

1306
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:36,049
apes, I think I quote myself correctly here.

1307
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:39,180
Apes have culture and nobody denies this.

1308
01:08:39,459 --> 01:08:41,580
I could not say it more strongly, right?

1309
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:44,140
Apes have culture. Nobody denies this.

1310
01:08:44,470 --> 01:08:46,080
Nobody I know denies this.

1311
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:48,899
But what we need is a pluralistic

1312
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:51,009
approach to culture.

1313
01:08:51,379 --> 01:08:54,770
Not all cultures are created equal, right? And so

1314
01:08:54,939 --> 01:09:00,479
apes have many different types of culture. They have very, we know this securely.

1315
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:02,750
They have cultures of know what to eat.

1316
01:09:03,618 --> 01:09:06,999
Maybe they would even starve if they wouldn't have this culture, know what to eat.

1317
01:09:07,008 --> 01:09:08,087
It's very strong in that

1318
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:11,328
they learn socially what to eat, you know, from those around them,

1319
01:09:11,337 --> 01:09:12,559
from their mothers and so on.

1320
01:09:12,889 --> 01:09:15,599
That's a, that's a culture, but it's a different culture,

1321
01:09:15,868 --> 01:09:16,917
but they clearly have it.

1322
01:09:17,618 --> 01:09:21,328
They also have got to know where cultures, where to be, you know,

1323
01:09:21,417 --> 01:09:26,337
and they also quite surely know their territory and so on, you know, so they

1324
01:09:26,457 --> 01:09:28,479
socially learn that too.

1325
01:09:28,608 --> 01:09:30,337
So they've got all kinds of cultures,

1326
01:09:30,528 --> 01:09:33,559
but when it comes to know how their culture

1327
01:09:33,663 --> 01:09:34,962
is basically

1328
01:09:35,104 --> 01:09:37,124
uh uh about no le

1329
01:09:37,292 --> 01:09:38,844
and know how that they trigger.

1330
01:09:39,313 --> 01:09:40,203
In each case.

1331
01:09:40,624 --> 01:09:43,374
Uh I use this term, by the way from Dan Sperber,

1332
01:09:43,383 --> 01:09:46,252
he made this very useful distinction between the stuff

1333
01:09:46,264 --> 01:09:49,673
that is already kind of there and just needs triggering

1334
01:09:49,943 --> 01:09:52,163
and the stuff that really needs copying.

1335
01:09:52,453 --> 01:09:53,854
And um Andrew Bask

1336
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,333
and I, we have recently worked on that to

1337
01:09:56,463 --> 01:09:59,664
lay more detail in, in that it's a, it's a paper and press,

1338
01:09:59,673 --> 01:10:01,244
I think you recently interviewed Andrew

1339
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:02,419
as well.

1340
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:05,509
So um so that that difference is very,

1341
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,259
very important when it comes to know how the know how is triggered

1342
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:14,020
but not copied in the sense that we have been talking about this year.

1343
01:10:14,189 --> 01:10:15,379
But in order

1344
01:10:15,660 --> 01:10:19,180
in order to have all of these things and language, you know,

1345
01:10:19,189 --> 01:10:22,129
and many other subdomains of human culture,

1346
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:23,979
we need know how copy

1347
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:27,049
and without it, we we, we cannot get that. So

1348
01:10:27,509 --> 01:10:29,520
um I would even say it like this

1349
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:31,850
apes have many types of culture,

1350
01:10:31,979 --> 01:10:36,959
but they do not seem to share in this special type of culture that we humans have

1351
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:41,120
and maybe other species have maybe whales and all right.

1352
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:43,979
But I would also say that this also doesn't

1353
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:47,720
mean that humans have all types of possible culture

1354
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:50,520
that is also not the case bats, for example,

1355
01:10:50,529 --> 01:10:53,640
they communicate in ranges that we can't communicate in.

1356
01:10:53,770 --> 01:10:56,879
So, you know, we wouldn't have this kind of uh culture if,

1357
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:00,134
if the bats have special types culture based on that, right?

1358
01:11:00,285 --> 01:11:00,834
So

1359
01:11:00,964 --> 01:11:04,475
you need to always look what kind of cultures do these species

1360
01:11:04,604 --> 01:11:07,015
show. And we see that there is a difference

1361
01:11:07,345 --> 01:11:10,674
in the kinds of cultures that apes and humans show just like there was a

1362
01:11:10,685 --> 01:11:13,424
difference between uh different other kinds of

1363
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,254
-- animals in the cultures
-- that they show.

1364
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:20,669
OK. So with all of that in mind, I have one last question then.

1365
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:25,299
So we've talked about uh differences or potential differences

1366
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:28,549
and similarities between ape culture and human culture.

1367
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,580
A a different kind of question

1368
01:11:31,759 --> 01:11:34,120
and related one is

1369
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:38,029
where do those differences come from?

1370
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:39,290
Yes.

1371
01:11:40,009 --> 01:11:41,589
Uh Well, Ricardo, uh

1372
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,629
this is the million dollar question

1373
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:45,109
and um

1374
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:49,009
and I don't think we have a very good answer to that

1375
01:11:49,229 --> 01:11:51,220
yet, you know. So I think

1376
01:11:51,839 --> 01:11:55,109
there is some good answers maybe more convincing

1377
01:11:55,229 --> 01:11:58,979
uh to some than to others, to all the other questions that you had.

1378
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:01,180
Um But for this one,

1379
01:12:01,529 --> 01:12:02,770
we are

1380
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:04,660
quite in the dark

1381
01:12:04,839 --> 01:12:05,060
yet.

1382
01:12:05,509 --> 01:12:07,919
I have argued and I might have used the

1383
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:10,060
same argument in the last interview that we did.

1384
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:13,000
Um I have argued in the past that in order

1385
01:12:13,009 --> 01:12:15,879
to try to shed light on this particular question,

1386
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:19,720
why we got the way that we got? And so on,

1387
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:22,189
we should first answer the question.

1388
01:12:22,339 --> 01:12:23,149
When

1389
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:26,180
did we go the way that we got first?

1390
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:31,569
And if we have a good understanding of when we became like that, then

1391
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:36,029
uh we can look at the circumstances that acted at the time and at the time,

1392
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:37,189
directly preceding it.

1393
01:12:37,709 --> 01:12:40,560
And that is ultimately the reason why even though

1394
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:43,500
I was a psychologist and a biologist before,

1395
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:49,200
um that now I still maintain these directions, but that I'm now an archaeologist.

1396
01:12:49,209 --> 01:12:54,350
So now I'm I'm trying to understand this when this is my, my current quest as

1397
01:12:56,149 --> 01:12:58,450
great. So, Doctor 10,

1398
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:00,810
uh as I said at the beginning,

1399
01:13:00,819 --> 01:13:05,209
I'm also leaving a link in the description box to our first interview.

1400
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:08,609
Uh Would you like to mention again where people

1401
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:11,209
can find you and your work on the internet?

1402
01:13:12,069 --> 01:13:14,370
So uh if you Google my name or it will,

1403
01:13:14,379 --> 01:13:17,040
the things that pop up will be the Google scholar account.

1404
01:13:17,049 --> 01:13:21,439
Of course, my, my website would be probably uh currently the best place.

1405
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:25,569
-- It's a, it's a Google site as well and, and easy to find. Thank you
-- so much.

1406
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:29,169
