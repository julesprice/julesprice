Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the Center.

1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,210
I'm your host as always Ricardo

2
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:08,369
Loops. And today I'm joined by Doctor James mccann.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,229
He's Professor Emeritus of History at Boston University.

4
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:13,609
His research and

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,639
teaching interests include agricultural and ecological history of Africa,

6
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:19,629
Ethiopia,

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:24,409
and the Horn of Africa field research methods in African studies,

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,250
the Agroecology of tropical disease and the history of

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,668
food slash cuisine in Africa and the Atlantic world.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,869
And today we are going to focus mostly on his book, Maize and Grace,

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,779
a History of Africa's Encounter with the new world crop.

12
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:46,430
So, Doctor mccann, welcome to the show. It's a huge pleasure to everyone.

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,419
Thank you for your invitation.

14
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,479
So, uh let's start, I guess at the beginning. So

15
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:57,650
uh we're going to talk about maize here today.

16
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:00,970
Where did maize originate from?

17
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:05,309
Maize is a new world crop that was

18
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:06,300
um

19
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:08,839
domesticated by

20
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:10,680
peoples in Mesoamerica.

21
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:14,040
And it's difficult, we don't know the exact

22
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,190
the first example of something we would call maize in the common term.

23
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,949
But there are examples of,

24
00:01:21,199 --> 00:01:22,069
of um

25
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,019
archaeological evidence of forgive the bat cave where

26
00:01:26,029 --> 00:01:28,500
they found something that looks a bit like maize

27
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:29,919
that has is on a,

28
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:31,949
on the ear with a, with a cob.

29
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:32,940
Um

30
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,709
And the evolution is the experimentation by local farmers.

31
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,959
We don't know

32
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,750
men and women both were involved probably.

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,190
But we don't really know that in Mesoamerica,

34
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,129
but the characteristics that were evolved over time

35
00:01:48,139 --> 00:01:52,379
was farmer selection of certain characteristics they wanted to

36
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,290
have available in their own diets and their own food.

37
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:01,269
And maize is remarkable and it's spread internationally. That's why my interest in

38
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:04,690
the arrival of maize and its propagation in Africa.

39
00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:06,730
It it's about farmer

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,809
household, local knowledge

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,110
only to some degree about elite a applications.

42
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,110
So it's the earliest history we don't really know for sure. The spread

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,179
me America

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,419
into

45
00:02:21,229 --> 00:02:23,759
North America and as far as New England.

46
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,860
And for example, this is an exa example of a New England flint

47
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:29,960
and

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,419
eight rows

49
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:33,399
and it's not something commercially viable,

50
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,160
but it represents the kind of movement of,

51
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,889
of, of Mays into new environments.

52
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,000
This other example here you see

53
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,960
this looks like what Columbus would have brought with him.

54
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,720
He brought Mays back from the Caribbean,

55
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,520
a Caribbean red

56
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,589
flint, which is this one

57
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,630
to Europe and he sent it to his friends

58
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,830
in different places in Germany and Italy and Spain.

59
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,630
And it began to be experimented with and eventually was

60
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,360
taken over by farmers themselves who were the key innovators

61
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,210
both in Africa and in Europe.

62
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,800
When May spread as this popular crop that

63
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:14,059
had certain characteristics that were overwhelmingly popular with farmers

64
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,470
as they sought to

65
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,720
both be commercial but also to feed their local populations.

66
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,589
And what are some of those characteristics?

67
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,830
What are the most distinct traits of mace

68
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:30,130
maize is one, it is wind pollinated

69
00:03:30,869 --> 00:03:32,770
in another. It's not pollinated by insects

70
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,470
or by um

71
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,039
by other means.

72
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,440
And on the maize plant, you have both male and female parts of the plant plant.

73
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,149
So it can self pollinate.

74
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:44,990
But for the most part, the wind moves the pollen

75
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:48,050
between fields and between plants.

76
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:51,970
So you get automatically a mix, genetic mixing

77
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,160
that gives you a final result of texture

78
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,199
color

79
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,100
and the characters

80
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,440
characteristics of the plant itself.

81
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,279
So it has this characteristic that farmers have, have,

82
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:04,759
have the ability to control it

83
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:07,589
by by hand moving the column.

84
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,119
Um so that they have characteristics that they favor

85
00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:13,470
whether it's color or texture

86
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,720
or for example, how long it stores?

87
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,390
Uh some varieties of maize do not store very long at all,

88
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,428
you have to consume them or they go bad,

89
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,579
other ones will last longer. So farmers are making these choices over generations.

90
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:28,989
What the end result is? You find

91
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,320
the difference between these two.

92
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:34,980
I would say it's all about the farmer choices.

93
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,980
Another lead scientist, the farmer choices at the early level

94
00:04:39,309 --> 00:04:39,950
and

95
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,549
the popularity of it as it spread around the world was because

96
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:49,549
it was controllable along with other new world. Um additions like capsicum pepper.

97
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,760
We can't recognize world cuisines without recognizing

98
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,369
the contribution of pepper capsicum.

99
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:57,480
Uh In

100
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,279
Indian,

101
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:00,149
Indian

102
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,630
Ethiopia, all varieties of taste

103
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,980
that we value coming from those new world exchanges

104
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:08,890
with new world. Yeah.

105
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:17,209
And uh what are some of the ways maize differs from other uh common crops?

106
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,040
Well, as I said,

107
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:24,170
the wind pollination factor is something that farmers have to learn to control

108
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,359
all the way to Monsanto. Suing farmers for

109
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,470
the pollen being carried by the wind across fields in Iowa

110
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:34,910
um or or elsewhere where the control of the pollen is

111
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,190
the key issue about how do you make it commercially viable.

112
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,109
Um

113
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,910
But the the difference when something like wheat,

114
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,910
wheat is wheat is self pollinating,

115
00:05:44,989 --> 00:05:45,609
it doesn't,

116
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:50,140
the pollen does not move more than a few microns from different parts of the plant.

117
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:52,239
Rice is is self pollinating.

118
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:56,959
Uh So maize dis distinctive and it is wind pollinated, not insect pollinated

119
00:05:58,059 --> 00:06:02,179
and that makes a huge difference. But farmers understood this pretty quickly

120
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,489
when any place where we see where maize has become adapted as a ma a major crop,

121
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:10,869
you see that farmers are adjusting their own knowledge systems

122
00:06:11,049 --> 00:06:13,959
to the characteristics of maize. Maize is

123
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,559
hermaphrodite.

124
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,470
It represents both genders on the same club, but it also is

125
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,320
uh

126
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,329
I guess morally and and unquestionably about sharing sexual

127
00:06:29,529 --> 00:06:30,519
engagements,

128
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,059
right?

129
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,859
And so, I mean,

130
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:39,910
we're also going to talk about how maize spread across the globe and specifically

131
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:41,459
uh in Africa.

132
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,510
Uh but what are,

133
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,260
are there specific ecological conditions where

134
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:50,799
maize produces high higher yields,

135
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:54,899
where it grows, it grows and is farmed the best?

136
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,799
Well, of course, that's a key characteristic.

137
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,899
And when

138
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:00,679
maize came from,

139
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:03,850
you know, directly, for example, from, from the

140
00:07:04,929 --> 00:07:06,700
Atlantic trade with Brazil

141
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,559
and the trade, the Atlantic trade of course has is a complex interaction of sugar

142
00:07:11,809 --> 00:07:14,399
and human labor, forced labor, you know,

143
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:22,079
slaves um going across and carrying maize as a potential crop brought into

144
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:26,309
the African case into West Africa, later into Southern Africa.

145
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,390
But also up the Nile

146
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:31,540
and into the Indian Ocean world where

147
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:34,049
the word the the Kiswahili

148
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:34,790
word

149
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:35,200
for

150
00:07:35,309 --> 00:07:36,329
maize is

151
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:36,809
Muindi.

152
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,640
It's from India.

153
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,239
It doesn't come, didn't come from India.

154
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:45,720
But the the understanding, the popular understanding of where this thing came from

155
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,720
became the name.

156
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,290
If we look at the name for maize in different cultures, different languages.

157
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:55,149
We learned a lot about people's perceptions of that crop.

158
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:56,739
Um

159
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:02,890
In, in Malawi, for example, the word the word for, for maize, it means

160
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,619
um

161
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,220
from our ancestors, even though it came fairly late into place like Malawi,

162
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,309
we replaced sorghum.

163
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,540
Sorghum is not as productive as maize and, and farmers at each location,

164
00:08:16,549 --> 00:08:19,299
whether it's tropical, subtropical um

165
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:20,609
or

166
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:22,239
somewhat um

167
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:27,049
affected by the amount of moisture available by rainfall by, by climate

168
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:28,570
farmers adjusted to that.

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,119
So you see the varieties of maize in all over the world

170
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,729
ad adapted

171
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,020
and again, not so much like recent times by corporations

172
00:08:38,239 --> 00:08:41,969
who are, who are attempting to make maize science.

173
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,590
And that's the sort of dominant the farmers made

174
00:08:45,599 --> 00:08:48,460
this choice every year when they selected their seeds,

175
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,030
they would, they would

176
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:52,739
choose some of the, some of the Mazier

177
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:55,539
for seed and some for consumption.

178
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,679
And the seed represented their sense of what

179
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,929
they identified is the characteristics they wanted.

180
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,260
And that includes the maize plant as forage, for animals.

181
00:09:05,729 --> 00:09:07,679
So for example, in Italy,

182
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,130
the the the the the fact that the farm that the peasant farmers were able to

183
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,710
use the maize plant,

184
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,640
not just the the the ear,

185
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,799
but the plant itself to feed their cattle meant that they could keep the cattle in

186
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:24,400
the barns on their farm and not send them into the mountains in the winter.

187
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:28,309
And what they get from that is distinctive kinds of

188
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:33,250
products of the animals were eating the maize such as Parmesan,

189
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,130
such as Gorgonzola, the cheeses, Italians, Italy is so well known for

190
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,400
is part of the product of maize

191
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,640
is at the core feeding of the animals.

192
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,159
So they can be kept in the barns and fed over the course of the winter.

193
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,200
And thus ST storing the the milk

194
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,659
in the form of cheese.

195
00:09:53,469 --> 00:09:58,520
So it's not that uh maize uh only

196
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:01,859
uh I mean grows well or produces a

197
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:06,469
good yield, good yields in specific climates.

198
00:10:06,479 --> 00:10:10,809
I mean different kinds of maize have been adapted to

199
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:14,770
different sorts of uh climates and environments.

200
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,210
-- Yeah. With
-- the restrictions on maize, within the constraints

201
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,489
that farmers would respect would would um

202
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:26,200
develop is maize is is vulnerable to drought

203
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:28,270
moisture sensitive.

204
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,090
So if you, if you have a drought prone area, either seasonally

205
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,799
or within a year, you have to realize that maize is vulnerable to,

206
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,669
to moisture, to moisture uh availability.

207
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:44,869
The other way, maize tends does not store as long as other

208
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:49,469
crops, millets store for a very long time. Ethiopian crop

209
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:49,869
tiff

210
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,010
will, will store for years.

211
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,549
Maze, you get four months,

212
00:10:56,229 --> 00:11:00,320
maybe maximum six months but unlikely. So you've got to eat it, move it,

213
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,760
preserve it somehow.

214
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,520
So it has those constraints on maze.

215
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,820
And so that's why you don't see maze as a domino c

216
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,739
everywhere.

217
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:09,630
OK.

218
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:12,619
Uh And when it comes, uh we've,

219
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,200
you've already mentioned some of that but when it

220
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,539
comes how and why it spread across the globe

221
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,859
apart from the trades

222
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,679
you've already mentioned,

223
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:26,979
were there any specific, for example,

224
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:32,700
political or economic reasons for it to become so widespread?

225
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,739
Uh

226
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,409
uh

227
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,400
Well, yes, one, it's, here's an example and this is not from the Africa work I did,

228
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,619
but the work I've done in Italy

229
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:44,640
where the key crop for the

230
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:45,219
veto.

231
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,739
Venice was an empire,

232
00:11:47,359 --> 00:11:49,260
an empire of trade. But

233
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,260
they, the, the, the Venetian patricians,

234
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,789
the rich folks in Venice itself told the farmers on the terra

235
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:56,419
firma of

236
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,320
who they controlled that. You will pay your taxes and wheat.

237
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,059
And the farmer said wheat doesn't work well here in northern northern Italy,

238
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,380
wheat works in southern Italy and elsewhere.

239
00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:08,979
So we want to start

240
00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:10,869
paying our taxes in maize.

241
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,530
And at first, the patricians in Venice said,

242
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:16,409
no, we want wheat and we control you.

243
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:19,070
So the battle eventually was won by the peasants

244
00:12:19,719 --> 00:12:20,679
in the terra firma.

245
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,719
And

246
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,760
because of the, the, the the plague and other kinds of situations,

247
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:29,400
they won the day and were allowed to pay their taxes in maize.

248
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:34,440
And of course, maize then becomes the basis for the diet in northern Italy of polenta

249
00:12:35,469 --> 00:12:38,530
rather than pasta is an importation from Southern Italy.

250
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:42,609
And the same thing happens where maize is introduced in

251
00:12:42,619 --> 00:12:47,059
uh in Africa where fa farmers find it help help

252
00:12:47,409 --> 00:12:51,090
important to adapt maize as their fundamental crop.

253
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:54,809
But one of the liabilities of maize is it has

254
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:56,919
insufficient amino acids.

255
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,000
So you have the

256
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,359
pro from

257
00:12:59,859 --> 00:13:00,340
palabra

258
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,760
is disease that you find

259
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:05,460
especially in agricultural societies

260
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:06,119
in

261
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:07,690
Southern

262
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:09,450
the American South, in

263
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,549
Italy

264
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,090
and any and in southern Africa, any place you have a dominance of maize in the diet

265
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,580
that came as part of,

266
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:17,950
of maize being

267
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:20,700
a really popular crop for farmers to grow

268
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:21,549
is Pella

269
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:23,039
is a skin disease

270
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,679
and you find it places where the diet becomes too dependent on maize.

271
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,409
But you don't find that in Mid

272
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,030
America

273
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,280
because in

274
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,119
Mesoamerica,

275
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:35,150
they process maize

276
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,419
using lies

277
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:39,559
and change the chemistry so that you get a complete uh

278
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,880
amino acid and complete protein by having a maize based diet.

279
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:46,950
It has to do with processing. How do you process the maze?

280
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,479
But they didn't do that

281
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,590
in um

282
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,820
in other places, Italy, Africa, the southern us

283
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,619
where Pella

284
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,520
becomes a serious problem

285
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,219
until it's understood that you have to complete the proteins by,

286
00:14:00,229 --> 00:14:02,039
by research in the early 20th century.

287
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,260
And when exactly did maize get to Africa?

288
00:14:09,729 --> 00:14:11,750
Well, we don't, of course, completely know,

289
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,989
but we can look at um

290
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,700
places early on, we begin to get adaptation.

291
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,530
For example, a na uh the names given to maize

292
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,270
you find in places in Nigeria

293
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:25,909
or West Africa

294
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:29,419
that the the words for maize tell us something.

295
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,119
The the um

296
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:31,789
the

297
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:32,640
Akan in

298
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,909
Ghana, uh

299
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,630
the word for, for,

300
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,700
for maize means something from the foreigners

301
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,289
in Ethiopia. Then one of the words for a maze was

302
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:43,460
Yar

303
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:44,280
Maila.

304
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,580
In other words, the sor

305
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,059
go from across the ocean,

306
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:50,869
it looks maize looks like.

307
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,020
So, so sorghum or Sorghum looks like maize when it's growing

308
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:55,729
early on.

309
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:59,619
But that the factor of people recognizing saying it's the so

310
00:14:59,739 --> 00:15:01,039
them from across the sea.

311
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:05,260
And now when you go to to the place of within Ethiopia,

312
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,700
I work, it's just called

313
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,309
Mahila,

314
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:08,619
which just means Sorghum,

315
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:09,979
it's not Sorghum.

316
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:12,789
But people understand that the word tells you

317
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:15,010
people's perceptions of when this arrived.

318
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,340
Uh So exact dates

319
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,219
by the

320
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:20,700
time the Portuguese arrive in Ethiopia,

321
00:15:21,109 --> 00:15:24,539
they're finding some maize there and they tell us what they're growing.

322
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,460
And

323
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,140
you can see the maize has already arrived.

324
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,400
But we don't have a clear historical record

325
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,409
because that's something takes place in the

326
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:34,880
basic level of human subsistence and doesn't

327
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:38,500
make it into the historical sources quite as clearly as it does later on.

328
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:45,239
And how does maize tie to Africa's Green Revolution?

329
00:15:46,469 --> 00:15:48,559
Well, the Green Revolution originally

330
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,460
was done with rice for South Asia.

331
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,900
So, so for India, South Asia

332
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:59,140
and so that revolution was about doing short, short

333
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,530
that you have to have,

334
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:05,700
you have to have water and you have to have fertilizer and you get a huge growth in

335
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:07,049
food production

336
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,460
in South Asia

337
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:10,090
for Africa.

338
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:15,330
The the the attempt has been to say yes, maize is going to be for Africa

339
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,250
like rice was for South Asia

340
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,640
and that's done by has been done

341
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,760
by corporations by USA ID International Organizations.

342
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:24,710
Um

343
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:28,640
The key center for research on maize is in Mexico City

344
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,440
when I visited there.

345
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,830
Uh I was taken to uh there was Ethiopian there

346
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:35,520
who I

347
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:35,960
got,

348
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:38,119
I work in Ethiopia. So we became

349
00:16:38,469 --> 00:16:41,820
friends. He took me to a rural site outside of Mexico City.

350
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,309
Uh

351
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:45,799
and they were growing their maize

352
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:48,109
seed for which was going to

353
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,070
be introduced to Ethiopia.

354
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:55,659
Uh So the international nature of the research going on now the Green Revolution,

355
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:59,130
the idea was maize can be the center point of that for Africa,

356
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:05,790
but with the problems that maze has about stability and about incomplete proteins.

357
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,910
And so what he this Ethiopian

358
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,910
scientist was doing,

359
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,489
I'm developing a new variety

360
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:14,069
with complete

361
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,449
um

362
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:16,729
proteins.

363
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,800
So it would have to be identified having a market value,

364
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,060
you pay more for those seeds to have complete proteins.

365
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,858
And this this

366
00:17:25,989 --> 00:17:29,859
uh type of maize though was also introduced elsewhere in Africa

367
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:31,939
is part of what people hoped would be a green rev

368
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:35,119
kind of green revolution. And it has done that

369
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,520
the improvement in the the yield of the maize,

370
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,150
you improve maize is substantial to

371
00:17:42,589 --> 00:17:45,060
um 68 tons per hectare

372
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,640
compared to two tons per hectare in local varieties.

373
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:53,619
So that is Africa was has been seen as the key to that

374
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,430
in many ways. It is

375
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,510
although

376
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,119
for example,

377
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,900
Ethiopian restaurants are very popular in around the world but in in the US

378
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,489
and in in Europe

379
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,170
and you will not find maize even though it's the number one crop in Ethiopia,

380
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,670
you will not find maize on the diet of

381
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,170
Ethiopia, the menu of Ethiopian restaurants

382
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,530
because it's not traditionally their ideal

383
00:18:16,489 --> 00:18:16,949
food,

384
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:19,229
the food of poverty.

385
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,829
Um you can buy ears of maize on the street, roasted maize on the street,

386
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,390
very inexpensive.

387
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,989
But as a as a fund fundamental part of diet

388
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:29,359
problematic.

389
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:38,729
And why is it that uh when it comes to Africa, people decided on maize?

390
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,520
I mean, why wasn't it

391
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,569
some other crop.

392
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,719
Well, they have, you can, you can look at each individual situation.

393
00:18:46,729 --> 00:18:49,660
The place I work in Ethiopia, they had a full

394
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,310
maize came very late. It was there as a garden crop,

395
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,079
early

396
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:54,880
yielding.

397
00:18:55,459 --> 00:18:57,469
It's the first crop of the year.

398
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:59,540
You have it in your, your household garden.

399
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,420
Um,

400
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:05,550
you get the first milky stage, you can eat milky stage maize or wait,

401
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,750
wait till it dries and then process it.

402
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:09,869
But it's the first crop you're going to get.

403
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:11,079
Um

404
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,349
But there, there they had other crops,

405
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,800
they had death in wheat and barley.

406
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,689
And it was a very, very diversified cropping system. The farmers understood well

407
00:19:21,969 --> 00:19:24,729
in other places, places in Southern Africa, for example,

408
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,579
it arrived, it replaced Sorghum

409
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,949
because it was much more productive. And the African farmers

410
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,770
all over Southern Africa said this thing will give us a yield quickly

411
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,719
and it is a food that we can adapt into our diet.

412
00:19:37,989 --> 00:19:40,010
So sorghum has almost disappeared.

413
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:43,930
And maize is the crop that has many different varieties

414
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,750
in all the countries of Southern Africa. All different names.

415
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,800
Basically, it's what Americans would call, call grits

416
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,209
or Italians would call polenta.

417
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:57,430
Uh So maze in its various forms, ref reflects the the

418
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:01,130
choice of farmers to say this thing gives an early yield.

419
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,869
But the new varieties, the green revolution varieties yield much later

420
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:10,910
and you don't eat them at the m milky stage. At the green stage.

421
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,140
You have, you have to wait and dry them and then process them.

422
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:18,729
So it feeds into the industrialization of of mills

423
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:21,579
that began to change the way that the market

424
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,750
affected.

425
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,170
What kind of maize farmers were growing.

426
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,180
And the government would say, ok, you may, may grow

427
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,750
only this kind of maize because we cannot sell colored maize.

428
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:32,739
B

429
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,459
maize drops out of the market

430
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:38,060
because the international market say we want white maize.

431
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,719
And if yellow maize is grown, yellow maize is useful for poultry

432
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,290
who likes white yolks and their eggs,

433
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,780
the yellow comes from the beta

434
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,599
carotene in the yellow maize.

435
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,550
Hm

436
00:20:53,949 --> 00:20:57,209
So you have these adaptations where the Millers are saying we want this

437
00:20:57,219 --> 00:21:00,270
kind of maize because that's the one we can sell into international markets.

438
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,430
And so you have it for Africa. Virtually all of the African maize is white

439
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,660
in the US, maize is for livestock

440
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,489
and you want your, your the fat of your livestock to be kind of a little bit yellow.

441
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:18,750
So the the yellow maize is dominant in North America

442
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,079
and in Europe too, white maize is still there.

443
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,310
You can buy polenta, either white or red, depending on your taste.

444
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,479
What you're eating the polenta with,

445
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:28,800
with, with fish

446
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:35,069
or with uh with, with the tomato sauce, et cetera. So these are consumer preferences

447
00:21:35,479 --> 00:21:38,800
that reflect the larger market preferences of the kind

448
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:41,680
of maize that farmers are going to be growing

449
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,640
to produce commercially for the market.

450
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:51,189
So uh politics and economics also certainly play a big

451
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:56,290
role in the adoption and spread of maize across Africa.

452
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,709
Right?

453
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:57,589
Yes.

454
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:59,310
So if you look at a place like Zimbabwe,

455
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,689
which did fantastic research on maize development,

456
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,569
the law system

457
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:08,770
eventually through the 20th century said, OK, you may not grow

458
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,530
maize which is not white.

459
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:15,390
Uh because white is the international market and we're producing

460
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,869
some of the best hybrid maize developed through research

461
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,069
came out not out of the North America,

462
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,540
out of Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, which became Zimbabwe.

463
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,670
Because the the, the,

464
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:32,750
the maize, the scientists there, the white, the white Rhodesian scientists

465
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,959
developed a incredibly productive uh

466
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,709
variety. But for that variety of, of really

467
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:40,709
um

468
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,109
productive maze in terms of, of the of the economic perspective

469
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:48,859
that you had to have just the right soils,

470
00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:50,410
just the right moisture,

471
00:22:50,689 --> 00:22:53,040
just the right seasonal conditions.

472
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:57,469
And of course, the white population in Southern Rhodesia controlled those things.

473
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,219
And the the black farmers were not given access to this new variety.

474
00:23:03,229 --> 00:23:04,329
These new varieties

475
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,699
incredibly productive is from a scientific point of view, economic point of view.

476
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:14,729
But you also founded. This is a story I got when I was doing work, work in Zimbabwe,

477
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,599
one of those scientists

478
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:20,410
showed me a chart he made, he said, chart showed, wait a second.

479
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,229
Why is suddenly

480
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:24,540
this this production going up?

481
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:26,229
But we're not,

482
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,670
we're not charting.

483
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,469
He said in his own handwriting, he wrote in this little chart from the 19 sixties.

484
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,569
He showed me this chart

485
00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:36,560
when I interviewed him,

486
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:39,069
he wrote African farmers.

487
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,479
In other words, African farmers had found the, the, the new crop,

488
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,319
the new variety and were using it

489
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,219
and adapting it in their own terms. Even though the government was

490
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,599
trying to suppress

491
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,579
their, their role in production of, of, of maize.

492
00:23:54,589 --> 00:23:57,780
Very, very, very political economic,

493
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,140
in a fascinating way,

494
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:00,739
which is what led me into

495
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,520
and what led me into you didn't ask this question, but I'll answer it anyway.

496
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:08,430
How did I begin to understand

497
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:08,989
and,

498
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,449
and want to explore more of the role of maize

499
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,550
because I grew up with maize fields all around me as a kid.

500
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,359
I grew up in Illinois

501
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,709
and Illinois is a big maize producing area.

502
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,319
But when I was interviewing farmers in Ethiopia after the famine,

503
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:24,550
uh there was a socialist government in

504
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,310
place that was trying to control farmer activities

505
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,239
and farmers were growing their different varieties of crops.

506
00:24:31,709 --> 00:24:32,680
And then suddenly

507
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,239
when I said, OK, what did you go last year, the year before that?

508
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,420
It's a year before that.

509
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,560
They were saying,

510
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,880
well, this is the maize, maize, maize, maize.

511
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,290
Really? I said maize is drought

512
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,839
is drought um

513
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:44,800
affected.

514
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:47,069
Um it, it it is

515
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,770
not the best nutrition in the world, it doesn't fit your normal diet.

516
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,199
Why are you doing this?

517
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,839
And so I began to understand it's because the

518
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:58,589
government is saying we don't care what you grow

519
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,920
as long as you pay in these other crops.

520
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:04,599
And they said that maize was safe because the government wouldn't

521
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:06,089
take it from him.

522
00:25:06,949 --> 00:25:08,290
It was a political decision

523
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:08,969
that,

524
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,650
that affected what farmers did,

525
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:14,400
right? Uh And uh I mean, uh

526
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:18,969
going along the uh that line of what uh I would also like

527
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:22,670
to ask you a little bit about the particular case of South Africa,

528
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,849
which you have done some work on.

529
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,310
Uh you mentioned science there for example.

530
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,869
And I asked you about politics, but in the particular case of South Africa,

531
00:25:33,219 --> 00:25:39,229
uh in what ways did politics, science and race intermingle there?

532
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:42,989
Well, for Southern Africa, we you know the politics,

533
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,709
we know of the the arrival of Europeans

534
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,910
in the 17th century and then spread from the cape

535
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,089
into colonial settings that were originally

536
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,000
the the arrival of uh Dutch later on the the the British Empire incorporated that

537
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,979
but the basic population

538
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:02,339
still was

539
00:26:03,209 --> 00:26:04,189
agricultural.

540
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:08,069
Um And they of course had needs for the mines.

541
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:11,880
So the Southern African economies were about gold first,

542
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:14,369
sorry, diamonds first, then gold

543
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,949
and that became the diamond.

544
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,910
So what do you need? You need labor?

545
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:21,520
Mhm And when the labor is the black population

546
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:23,550
which needs to be fed

547
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,300
and the the mine owners were having to determine

548
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:31,589
what do we feed our mine workers to keep them

549
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,709
healthy enough to work

550
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:36,390
and maize became

551
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,579
the key crop for them. Uh

552
00:26:39,329 --> 00:26:40,800
And the the word

553
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,260
Milly. Milly pop is a South African word for

554
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,709
polenta or for the basic maize, which comes from the Portuguese Mili.

555
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:53,520
So merely was not maize, but word came to include maize

556
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,130
from the original Portuguese.

557
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:00,239
And so you have this phenomenon of the mind economy, creating

558
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:01,839
a sense of what is

559
00:27:02,959 --> 00:27:04,010
what is good food.

560
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:05,150
Um

561
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,079
And eventually the population came to define their full bellies

562
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:10,780
is the feeling you get

563
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,579
when you've eaten a big batch of maize.

564
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:20,560
And when that becomes a kind of a cultural norm of what feeling full is

565
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:21,739
um

566
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:24,760
maize becomes that key ingredient.

567
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:28,770
So the the miners also went back to their family farms when they worked,

568
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,939
headed out of the mines

569
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:32,000
and they began to grow maize

570
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,599
as down the crop.

571
00:27:33,609 --> 00:27:39,000
And that was women doing the work back home where men were the miners earning wages.

572
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,089
And therefore

573
00:27:41,189 --> 00:27:45,959
the the core diet became maze because it was low labor, lower labor.

574
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:46,910
Somebody I did mention

575
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,619
maze takes less labor, you can broadcast it.

576
00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:53,979
Um You don't have to do it by role, et cetera.

577
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,589
Uh So its characteristics meant it could be

578
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:59,709
adapted on small farms in which women's labor

579
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,150
was the key issue.

580
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,369
So Southern Africa, it was about mining,

581
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,569
the economy and eventually became the accepted

582
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,390
um

583
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,520
diet

584
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,589
was maize was the core of any meal.

585
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:18,819
Yes, there was sorghum a little bit here and there. You can still buy some Sorghum in

586
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,609
South African. Uh gro

587
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,619
groceries.

588
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:24,619
But for the most part, the basic diet is

589
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:25,489
maize,

590
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,630
white maze.

591
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:28,410
Mhm.

592
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:29,660
Right.

593
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:39,140
And do we know if uh maize has had uh any impact on the biodiversity of Africa?

594
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,449
Well, in some ways,

595
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:43,609
it's a negative effect because the farmer

596
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:46,459
incentives with political context in many cases

597
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:49,300
is maize is the crop that's

598
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:55,180
really yielding. It gives a very good yield for small farmers and you go to,

599
00:28:55,489 --> 00:28:58,989
you know, 6 to 8 tons per hectare of the new varieties.

600
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,660
So farmers are seeking both the commercial value of that to

601
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,640
to send to the the cities

602
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,780
but also it is very, very attractive is the local diet.

603
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:09,859
Um

604
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:11,160
So

605
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:13,550
the biodiversity

606
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,800
pushing maize as as USA ID does with the Agra,

607
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,449
the the this big development program

608
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:23,119
based upon maize is the primary crop.

609
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:23,880
Uh

610
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,770
So you have corporations Mon

611
00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:27,079
Monsanto

612
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,089
and of course May's production,

613
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:31,900
Monsanto is now owned by

614
00:29:32,869 --> 00:29:33,520
by year.

615
00:29:34,979 --> 00:29:38,160
So the big maize producers are all owned by drug companies

616
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,920
by chemical companies.

617
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:45,479
Dupont owned all of those, those early developers of of maize in North America

618
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:51,300
in Europe are all owned by now. Chemical drug companies, Dupont Bayer

619
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:52,880
um

620
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,660
go down the line. So it

621
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:59,599
it becomes a corporate crop and farmers are are dealing with markets

622
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:02,719
and their own food supply depending on where you are in Africa.

623
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,660
Maize is not the dominant crop in every part of Africa.

624
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,619
It is in, it is in southern Africa.

625
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,290
It is in Kenya, Tanzania. Ugali

626
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:13,319
is essentially grits

627
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:16,459
polenta. But for, for East Africa

628
00:30:16,739 --> 00:30:17,530
and that's

629
00:30:17,689 --> 00:30:19,979
I had a friend, a Ugandan friend

630
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,579
who came to Ethiopia

631
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:27,589
and she was dying to have ugali in her diet because she's from Uganda and for her food,

632
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:28,250
met maize.

633
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:31,800
At that point, Ethiopian restaurant, Ethiopian

634
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:35,640
national diet did not really include maize

635
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,119
for the

636
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:38,640
middle and upper class.

637
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,500
So, Mays has his fun role, role. It's not a friend of biodiversity.

638
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:45,750
Mhm

639
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,780
And uh a related question,

640
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:53,939
do we know what impact uh the introduction of

641
00:30:53,949 --> 00:30:58,810
maize had on African people's nutrition and health.

642
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:00,319
Well, I mentioned

643
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:00,729
pra

644
00:31:01,869 --> 00:31:06,770
too much dependent on maize but maize has its place because it yields early

645
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,060
depending on the variety you're growing.

646
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:13,199
You can be can be the first thing that comes as the first crop

647
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,770
you have. We have often Af African cultures have celebrations of the first crop.

648
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:21,349
The the new year begins. The first thing you can get is maize

649
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:24,890
because you can eat it the milky stage as we eat with

650
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,979
with uh we haven't mentioned there are five varieties of maize,

651
00:31:27,989 --> 00:31:29,300
one of which is sweet corn,

652
00:31:29,989 --> 00:31:32,449
uh which is the one you eat at the milky stage.

653
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:34,790
It's wonderful, delicious. Um

654
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,449
Something in the fall when the first maze comes in,

655
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,079
you wanna have um sweet corn.

656
00:31:41,689 --> 00:31:44,780
There's also popcorn, also dent corn, also flint corn.

657
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,869
These are both flint corns

658
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:51,910
which has the characters are scoring longer

659
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:57,050
uh which is a good thing, but they may take longer to mature and you're not,

660
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,189
you're not consuming them at the early stage.

661
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,010
So the the

662
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,709
the role of maize in the diet differs on which kind of cuisines you're talking about

663
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,630
which parts of Africa, Africa, of course, is a wonderfully diverse place,

664
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,410
linguistically, culturally,

665
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:13,829
in terms of diet

666
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:18,709
and maize plays an important part in a number of different African diets.

667
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,760
Mhm.

668
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:25,439
So for the second part of the interview, let's say,

669
00:32:25,449 --> 00:32:28,560
I would like to ask you a few more

670
00:32:28,569 --> 00:32:33,719
general questions not specifically related to maize itself.

671
00:32:33,729 --> 00:32:34,099
So

672
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:37,479
uh particularly when I asked you about Southern

673
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:40,280
Africa and also earlier in the interview,

674
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,829
you mentioned a little bit of it,

675
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:46,189
uh we talked about colonialism. So

676
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,150
uh what would you say was the role played by

677
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:55,099
colonialism when it comes to spreading crops across the globe?

678
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:01,939
And uh how was the adoption of different crops influenced by it?

679
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:07,890
Well, it depends on the situation. We have an example of Ethiopia where there was not

680
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:12,439
formal colonialism. The Italian period was only a few years.

681
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:17,069
So the adaptation was done essentially by farmers themselves,

682
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,890
taking advantage of what is available to them in terms

683
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,750
of their own strategies of cropping across a year and feeding

684
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,189
their community with a little bit of commercials, selling of, of grains.

685
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:29,280
But also the household level.

686
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:31,790
When you go to a place like Southern Africa

687
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:32,739
or or

688
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,660
so Southern Africa, you have a large arrival of the European population

689
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,050
who are originally Dutch and then English

690
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,060
and then some Portuguese and different, different groups arrive there.

691
00:33:46,069 --> 00:33:48,890
Europeans who control things

692
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:51,689
who are interested in feeding their labor

693
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,880
and feeding themselves. So you have in South Africa. So

694
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,609
a wonderful

695
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:58,650
um

696
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:01,050
tradition now of wine

697
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,219
because some of the early migrants out of Europe

698
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,540
were Huguenots.

699
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,909
The huguenots were escaping France because they were

700
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:11,458
oppressed by the Cat Catholic majority there.

701
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:14,370
And they began importing

702
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,188
uh vineyards

703
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:22,320
and that became now today, some of the best places to go and on wine tours in the world.

704
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:25,120
In my experience, South Africa is fantastic.

705
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:25,918
Um

706
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,110
And that links to the minefields needed labor.

707
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:34,438
The certain minefield, the vineyards needed labor and those laborers were eating

708
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,030
increasingly maize

709
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:37,928
getting back to maze

710
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:39,228
but it was

711
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:40,750
and some

712
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:45,618
places there was not a European population in East Africa, Kenya

713
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:47,389
a little bit Tanzania.

714
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,389
You had European populations that were affecting what farmers were doing

715
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:55,708
because they're expected that farmers would grow crops consumed by Europeans.

716
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,989
Uh West Africa,

717
00:34:58,389 --> 00:34:59,969
the conditions of malaria,

718
00:34:59,979 --> 00:35:03,260
something else I work on malaria meant that Europeans

719
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,010
and large populations did not populate West Africa,

720
00:35:06,709 --> 00:35:08,669
they would tend to populate as in,

721
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,489
in um in India

722
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:12,330
hill stations that were

723
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,110
fear from malaria. So Europeans would con control those spaces

724
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,419
and so the population was allowed to keep

725
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,219
um

726
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,340
local varieties of foodstuffs. So for example, in West Africa,

727
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,020
you had the possibility of,

728
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:33,409
of uh maize could be there as a first crop if you're clearing your forest.

729
00:35:33,919 --> 00:35:36,419
But the, the crops you really want to have in there are yam

730
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:37,360
cassava,

731
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,929
another manio,

732
00:35:39,149 --> 00:35:43,209
another new world crop. Uh If you, you know bubble tea.

733
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:45,590
Uh yes,

734
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:47,159
the bubbles are maniac. A

735
00:35:47,449 --> 00:35:47,639
casa.

736
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:49,860
We

737
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,100
were

738
00:35:50,879 --> 00:35:51,530
OK.

739
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:52,179
Uh

740
00:35:52,379 --> 00:35:54,360
So you have these mixes

741
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,280
sometimes called the Colombian exchange of crops coming from

742
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,689
the old new world to the old world.

743
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,449
I call it the I

744
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:02,719
call it not the exchange,

745
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,290
but the circulation

746
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:06,760
because the food crops along with peoples are

747
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:09,489
circulating and bringing their preferred foods with them.

748
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,600
So in West Africa, you have forest crops,

749
00:36:12,729 --> 00:36:16,040
yams, they're, they're grown in the, in the, in the, in

750
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,120
the forest floor.

751
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,489
Uh Maize is there for the first crop but then people want to get into yams

752
00:36:22,979 --> 00:36:24,350
and, and cassava

753
00:36:24,729 --> 00:36:29,139
and other kinds of crops taken from the forest, the biodiversity of the forest.

754
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:31,750
So all that's changing, of course as cities grow.

755
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,479
But the colonial effect is greatest in some places where

756
00:36:36,489 --> 00:36:39,330
there could be new neo Europe such as southern Africa,

757
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,120
Kenya.

758
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:45,889
But where there's factions of disease, the African population had resistance to

759
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:47,129
uh

760
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:51,120
the Europeans would tend to avoid those areas, control them for pro

761
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:53,570
production of food and for mining, et cetera.

762
00:36:53,909 --> 00:36:54,850
But uh

763
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,899
maize there was, it's,

764
00:36:57,129 --> 00:36:57,889
it's

765
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:58,520
it's

766
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:01,090
interest came from farmers themselves.

767
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,689
But also because Europeans were happy to have those workers under,

768
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:07,510
under colonial rule fed

769
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,199
and the maze then became a key part of that process of nutrition.

770
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:14,840
Mhm.

771
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:24,419
So uh in historical scholarship, one approach that people have is to look at the

772
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:30,510
causal relationship between climate and history. Uh What do you think of it?

773
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,149
Climate is fundamental to history,

774
00:37:34,649 --> 00:37:39,419
climate about seasonality. What is the annual cycle of, of

775
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,560
availability of moisture?

776
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:47,639
Uh Disease is also sea seasonal affected by climate by issues of climate.

777
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,449
It's the thing I'm working on now is sort of the more fundamental issue about water,

778
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:55,780
water, its presence, its absence, its movement,

779
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:57,540
it's movement through the seasons.

780
00:37:57,989 --> 00:37:58,860
And this is

781
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,790
deeply within

782
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:01,770
the

783
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:05,300
issue of climate change, climate change,

784
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,709
velvet of water.

785
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,719
But of course, just look at today's stuff in, in Ukraine. But

786
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,189
what do you do when you want to defeat your enemy?

787
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,939
This is what the Germans did in Italy in World War Two.

788
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:19,639
They said we're gonna stop the allied invasion in Italy

789
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,090
by flooding the farmers' fields because then

790
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,760
that will encourage malaria which will affect

791
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,510
the invading army. In this case, the British American uh

792
00:38:28,669 --> 00:38:30,070
invasion of Italy.

793
00:38:30,729 --> 00:38:33,070
And that was a specific military plan,

794
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:37,510
what's going on now, even though we're not quite identifying the source of it.

795
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,669
This is what the Russians are doing.

796
00:38:39,399 --> 00:38:43,659
They said we're going to blow up this dam and we're gonna flood this entire area

797
00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:44,780
to

798
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:49,060
impede the movement of, of, of military activity

799
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,479
and this gets back to

800
00:38:50,879 --> 00:38:55,739
the seasons in which empires within Africa, within Ethiopia. For example,

801
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:59,100
the the the armies moved only during the dry season.

802
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,209
If you move during the wet season, then the areas with malarial.

803
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,250
Uh so the seasonality of wind moisture is available is a big deal militarily

804
00:39:08,419 --> 00:39:09,989
in terms of the production of food.

805
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:11,060
In terms of,

806
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:15,949
you know, if you, if you look at people who are traveling, describing

807
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:20,189
events in Africa or the conditions in Africa, Europeans writing down what they're,

808
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,270
what they're encountering,

809
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,030
they only traveled in the dry season.

810
00:39:23,669 --> 00:39:25,850
They're only giving a partial view of what they're seeing

811
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:28,409
because they wouldn't go during the wet season

812
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:31,969
because it's one, it's muddy two, it's malarial

813
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:34,820
and the local merchants and,

814
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:39,169
and uh moving around are only doing their movement during that seasonality.

815
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,870
The seasons change, different parts of Africa,

816
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:44,250
but

817
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:48,600
it's that seasonal change and the, the issue of climate change,

818
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,639
which is now having major effects,

819
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:52,520
right?

820
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:59,270
Uh So I would like to ask you one last question slash topic. So,

821
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,649
uh of course, when it comes to history,

822
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,179
um I would like to ask you,

823
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:11,570
what do you think of approaches by people like Jared Diamond when

824
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:17,169
it comes to explaining why certain societies became more successful than others

825
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:24,300
and what we could call or at least some people call uh geographical determinism.

826
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:30,010
Well, that's always been a factor of how much is, are the conditions deterministic

827
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:32,050
and Jared Diamond lays out an argument.

828
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,120
That's interesting. To challenge

829
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:36,780
and it's good that it's there.

830
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:40,899
And it's, it's, it's an attempt at universal explanation of

831
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:43,060
human movement, human

832
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,500
political economic domination

833
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,570
based around on environmental issues to some degree. That's true.

834
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,300
Um

835
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:56,239
And I think that that any consideration of politics or of economic change

836
00:40:56,629 --> 00:41:00,040
or of interaction between different kinds of political systems

837
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,340
um has its foundations, environmental issue in environmental issues.

838
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,850
The fact that Europeans

839
00:41:06,149 --> 00:41:09,899
coming to Africa or even to North America or to, to the new world.

840
00:41:11,129 --> 00:41:12,669
It's about the movement of knowledge.

841
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,429
Part of that Colombian circulation I mentioned was the arrival in

842
00:41:18,139 --> 00:41:19,120
Latin America

843
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,860
of people who knew how to deal with

844
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,800
couple of climates.

845
00:41:25,669 --> 00:41:30,300
The people, the the the selection of who is that most valued as

846
00:41:30,959 --> 00:41:31,729
labor

847
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:36,750
out of the slave trade, going to the to the Carolinas in the US

848
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:37,620
because

849
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,419
the ones who are most valued came from Santa Gambia. They knew how to grow rice

850
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,439
and the the plantation owners. And so in, in um

851
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:46,989
in the Carolinas

852
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,790
were stayed in their, their uplands

853
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,699
and in areas that were not so much so affected by malaria or other diseases

854
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,909
and their, their African slaves were allowed to

855
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,040
move into swampy areas because they knew how to grow.

856
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,479
Um

857
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:04,879
love

858
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:05,850
rima rice.

859
00:42:06,169 --> 00:42:08,120
They were adapting the environment, they knew,

860
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:10,989
they knew how to deal with health, knew how to deal with

861
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,050
production.

862
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:14,409
And so the knowledge that moved into the new world

863
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:17,860
also was a key part of this whole exchange

864
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,409
and

865
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,780
politics got into who controlled who but also

866
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:25,689
adaptation to environmental issues.

867
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,860
If you want to understand

868
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,979
the geography of Ethiopia

869
00:42:30,189 --> 00:42:32,719
is a, is a place that's a place I work. Most,

870
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:34,709
you know, look at

871
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,239
climate seasonality

872
00:42:37,459 --> 00:42:41,659
and you see that people would move in and out of areas that were affected by malaria

873
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,820
or where they could grow one crop or another crop and

874
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:47,060
then harvest it and get back to a safer area.

875
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:48,959
Big factor

876
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,649
and you a diamond is helpful to have that, that

877
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:52,639
um

878
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:55,850
that perspective

879
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,719
that is

880
00:42:56,989 --> 00:42:58,370
environmental determinism,

881
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:01,010
but they will have nuance by local areas.

882
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:03,169
And that's the beautiful part of doing the,

883
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:05,760
doing the work and working with different people in different places.

884
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,139
Mhm.

885
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:07,860
So, yeah.

886
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:10,969
Uh I mean, I've also asked you about that because of course,

887
00:43:10,979 --> 00:43:15,500
a big part of Jared Diamond's argument is based on

888
00:43:15,739 --> 00:43:21,449
uh crops also, of course domesticated animals in certain specific latitudes

889
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:22,199
in the

890
00:43:22,304 --> 00:43:22,885
world.

891
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:25,725
Uh And uh since of course,

892
00:43:25,735 --> 00:43:29,024
our interview has been focused so much on maize

893
00:43:29,034 --> 00:43:32,155
and we touched on some other crops as well.

894
00:43:32,165 --> 00:43:38,094
Uh I was wondering, I mean, to what extent you would think

895
00:43:38,284 --> 00:43:39,274
um

896
00:43:39,485 --> 00:43:43,445
the factors that Jared Diamond points to

897
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:50,074
uh I, I mean, what uh how much of a role do you think they would play in

898
00:43:50,334 --> 00:43:51,445
human history?

899
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:54,870
Well, I would add to Jared Diamond as,

900
00:43:54,879 --> 00:43:58,189
as a um kind of marker of environmental determinism

901
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:01,469
with a reasonable coherent

902
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:04,669
and somewhat persuasive argument. But look at Alfred Crosby

903
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:07,840
who coined the term the Columbian exchange

904
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:11,959
that I modified to publicly of the interaction.

905
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:12,850
Um It

906
00:44:12,979 --> 00:44:13,800
is

907
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:16,229
is that uh

908
00:44:16,429 --> 00:44:19,280
Alfred Crosby talks about the the

909
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:21,189
biological imperialism

910
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:24,179
because the the arrival in the new world of cattle

911
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:25,870
and pigs,

912
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:27,979
right? And chickens

913
00:44:28,229 --> 00:44:31,149
and part of this global circulation transforms

914
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,750
the the physical environment.

915
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,000
When you release

916
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:39,330
hogs into the environment, they are extremely good at going feral

917
00:44:40,399 --> 00:44:41,110
and they, they,

918
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,459
they change the physical world they live in and humans are both either hunting them

919
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,560
or trying to domesticate them or

920
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:52,649
the the animals and the plants, of course, maize being a big one of

921
00:44:52,889 --> 00:44:53,949
globalization,

922
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:57,239
but this is also true of other, other crops

923
00:44:57,479 --> 00:45:00,159
and other kinds of animals. Um

924
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:03,310
you know, goats, sheep, cattle,

925
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:04,330
horses,

926
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,810
all of these things that transform

927
00:45:06,939 --> 00:45:12,189
the worlds they they move to and the adaptation of local populations quickly to

928
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:14,080
the horse. For example,

929
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,959
you know, native Americans in North America adaptations of the horse,

930
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:20,030
suddenly they become mobile,

931
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:23,149
suddenly they, they're able to hunt in different ways.

932
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:27,409
Suddenly they're able to, to to expand their own local local

933
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,500
control over different com competing groups

934
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,959
in new, in new ways. So

935
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:33,110
the

936
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,489
the Alfred Crosby approach to this, which has been adapted by people,

937
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,159
scholars from,

938
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:40,709
from all over the world are incorporating these

939
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:43,139
ideas and and playing them out in local areas

940
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:44,469
that makes sense for them.

941
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:46,120
But Jared Diamond

942
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:49,510
more popular is, is something to read.

943
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:52,120
Uh It's kind of New York Times best seller list.

944
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,830
But the Alfred Crosby stuff is also

945
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,540
uh to me uh

946
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:58,629
very good.

947
00:45:58,870 --> 00:46:01,790
And the colleagues I work with who are specialists

948
00:46:02,899 --> 00:46:06,280
when I, when I go someplace, it's not that I know things

949
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:07,290
others don't know.

950
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,330
But I absorb as his historian,

951
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:12,520
I'm absorbing the knowledge and interacting with my colleagues,

952
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,469
whether it's in Ghana,

953
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:15,060
we were talking about the

954
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:17,729
introduction of maize or in Ethiopia where we're

955
00:46:17,739 --> 00:46:19,620
driving through the countryside and I'm saying,

956
00:46:19,629 --> 00:46:20,550
what's going on there?

957
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:23,899
We're walking through the countryside. And I'm always asking questions

958
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,909
because they have the knowledge that I've been trying to interpret for a larger

959
00:46:28,649 --> 00:46:31,750
uh audience as an academic, as a historian.

960
00:46:32,709 --> 00:46:34,719
So these things are very, very global,

961
00:46:34,899 --> 00:46:37,889
it helps to have people kind of tweaking the narrative

962
00:46:38,139 --> 00:46:40,520
by publishing books like Jared Diamond.

963
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,659
But it's not that we say gee he's got it. Right.

964
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:43,449
Um

965
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:45,949
He's after all, you know, his original background,

966
00:46:46,439 --> 00:46:48,620
he's a gastroenterologist. Mhm.

967
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,320
Right.

968
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,159
And we trust doctors to a degree. Yes.

969
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,350
Yeah. Right.

970
00:46:56,510 --> 00:47:03,520
So uh Doctor mccann, uh I'm leaving a link to your book Maze And Grace,

971
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:07,399
a History of Africa's encounter with the new World Cup crop

972
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,429
in the description box of the interview.

973
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:13,310
Uh Would you like to mention any places on

974
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:16,000
the internet where people can find your work?

975
00:47:17,449 --> 00:47:20,239
Well, I think the internet being what it is, you can, you can do that.

976
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:25,010
Um What I'm getting now, I just was at Oxford University Press asked me

977
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:26,520
to write a chapter

978
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,429
on malaria in Africa.

979
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:34,370
And malaria in Africa came from my own work with, again, with colleagues

980
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:37,840
um who work on malaria in Africa and elsewhere.

981
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,800
But um people I got malaria when I was doing field work in Africa

982
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:43,239
uh in, in Ethiopia,

983
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:46,560
you know, an area where the maize stuff was going on.

984
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,500
And I didn't ask go malaria.

985
00:47:48,659 --> 00:47:52,340
But suddenly I had 100 and five degree fever and had to

986
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:56,649
go back out of my my rural area five hours by mule

987
00:47:56,939 --> 00:48:00,179
to get to the nearest road to the nearest light bulb.

988
00:48:00,649 --> 00:48:01,659
Oh my God.

989
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,379
And so malaria became an interest and

990
00:48:05,129 --> 00:48:09,629
the maze. Malaria connection is one chapter of of um maize and grace.

991
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:14,189
And so male malaria is where I I appear on the internet.

992
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:17,750
I'm constantly getting notes saying you've been cited by these 100 times.

993
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:19,709
I said really

994
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,419
I'm not doing

995
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,510
and it's, it's mainly now about the medical malaria stuff

996
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:27,350
that links to the maze. All these things are linked.

997
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,229
Um

998
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,459
And now

999
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:30,659
back to the North Fundament

1000
00:48:30,919 --> 00:48:31,669
of water

1001
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,870
in which I'm doing a plenary panel for a international meeting in Finland

1002
00:48:37,149 --> 00:48:37,870
next year.

1003
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,209
And that is to draw people together around

1004
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,250
what is the meaning of water?

1005
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,000
Meanings of water

1006
00:48:45,229 --> 00:48:46,649
as something physical

1007
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:49,459
is something psychological is something

1008
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:50,709
cultural

1009
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,419
and water takes us to all kinds of ways

1010
00:48:53,429 --> 00:48:56,399
that people signify their sainthood if they're in a,

1011
00:48:56,409 --> 00:48:57,169
in a, uh

1012
00:48:57,909 --> 00:48:59,090
religious religious setting.

1013
00:48:59,399 --> 00:48:59,889
Um,

1014
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,260
and for example, in the 88, the 18 fifties, this

1015
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:05,639
short story,

1016
00:49:05,949 --> 00:49:07,679
the British traveler in Ethiopia

1017
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:09,239
came down with fever

1018
00:49:09,629 --> 00:49:10,439
and it's called

1019
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,959
eu, he understood this as I have a fever. What do I do?

1020
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:17,110
He's riding around the countryside with people and they said,

1021
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,879
what you need to do is stand in this tree and we're gonna dump water on your head

1022
00:49:21,149 --> 00:49:22,729
and this will deal with your fever.

1023
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,560
He said, well, first of all, it knocked him off, his horse,

1024
00:49:25,889 --> 00:49:27,120
knocked him senseless

1025
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,449
and he felt slightly better at the end of this ordeal.

1026
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:30,629
At

1027
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,120
the same time,

1028
00:49:32,129 --> 00:49:36,419
there's someone in Malvern England who's going through a water therapy treatment,

1029
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,290
somewhat, somewhat similar

1030
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,199
and that person was Charles Darwin.

1031
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:44,239
So water is this, this,

1032
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:46,989
this universal, of course, it's universal,

1033
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,610
but the nuances and local cultures and local

1034
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,939
material versus belief systems

1035
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,949
is the thing that I'm working on now. And you find examples of that

1036
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,520
all over the world

1037
00:49:58,669 --> 00:50:01,199
where suddenly cli that links to climate change.

1038
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,709
Very interesting.

1039
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:09,860
So, Doctor mccann, uh thank you so much for taking the time to come on the show.

1040
00:50:09,870 --> 00:50:12,389
It's been a real pleasure to talk to you

1041
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:12,929
too.

1042
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:13,830
Say

1043
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:14,100
no

1044
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:14,919
or the

1045
00:50:15,669 --> 00:50:17,100
equivalent of the Italian.

1046
00:50:17,469 --> 00:50:20,350
Yeah. In this case, uh it would be bo

1047
00:50:20,919 --> 00:50:20,959
part

1048
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:24,580
here. It's still the afternoons. OK?

1049
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,800
Time change, time change. So

1050
00:50:26,979 --> 00:50:28,649
thank you very much Ricardo.

1051
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,590
Very interesting. You're, you're uh
