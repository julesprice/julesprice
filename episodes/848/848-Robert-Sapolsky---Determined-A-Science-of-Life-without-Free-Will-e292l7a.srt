Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the Center.

1
00:00:03,599 --> 00:00:05,440
I'm your host as always Ricardo Lobs.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,050
And today I'm joined for a third time by Doctor Robert

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:09,960
Sapolsky.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,640
And today we're talking about his latest book,

5
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:16,899
Determined The Science of Life without free will.

6
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:20,979
And I'm also leaving the links to our first two interviews

7
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,030
in the description of this one. So Doctor

8
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,360
Sapolsky, welcome back to the show. It's always a pleasure to everyone.

9
00:00:27,829 --> 00:00:30,899
Well, likewise seeing you again and uh

10
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,529
glad we're on the other side of the pandemic. A pleasure to be here.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,840
OK.

12
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:39,680
So in our first two interviews,

13
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:46,000
we talked a lot about the science of human behavior and this time focusing on

14
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:49,819
questions surrounding free will and determinism.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,080
Are there specific aspects of the science of human behavior that you would

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:00,900
deem to be the most important here when considering these types of questions?

17
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:07,150
Well, um just as a preamble, my, my

18
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:09,260
song and dance is that

19
00:01:09,459 --> 00:01:13,230
there's no free will. We have none whatsoever.

20
00:01:13,419 --> 00:01:16,339
Um which puts me fairly

21
00:01:16,559 --> 00:01:22,169
far on the extreme of the continuum of people thinking about this. Um

22
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,510
but that we have no free will at all. And

23
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:31,730
this is relevant to everything about how we became, who became uh individually,

24
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,120
all of that, why you just did what you did.

25
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:35,300
Um But

26
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,639
in terms of where that's most important,

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,760
um

28
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,720
just to focus on the very narrow area, which

29
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,239
is anything but narrow.

30
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:51,849
Um The biggest implication of that is none of us are entitled

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,809
to anything.

32
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,819
None of us have earned

33
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,260
to be treated any differently than anyone else.

34
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:02,160
Of course, we may need to be treated differently.

35
00:02:02,169 --> 00:02:05,959
Uh Like if you're uncontrollably violent,

36
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:08,119
people have to be protected from you.

37
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:12,720
Um If you have extremely good motor skills through no,

38
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:15,259
you know, achievement of your own,

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,770
uh Maybe you're a candidate to be a good neurosurgeon,

40
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,710
but none of us have earned the right to have our needs

41
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,660
be considered more important than anyone else's.

42
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,729
And so, uh it's one thing to try to answer the question of free will.

43
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:41,630
I mean, if it exists or not, but another thing is why and when people believe

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,520
in free will, I mean, are there specific

45
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:53,550
cues that people pay attention to specific variables that play a role in how much

46
00:02:53,559 --> 00:02:57,089
free will people attribute to themselves or to

47
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,389
someone else when evaluating a particular action?

48
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,289
Well,

49
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:07,960
you're right and people almost universally

50
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:12,369
uh believe that they are the agents of their action.

51
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,119
Um Like 90% of philosophers fall into a camp uh

52
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:21,559
called compatible list views of free will.

53
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,320
These are people, they're not saying there's magic,

54
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,179
they're not taking theological stances, whatever they say.

55
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,839
Yeah, the world is made of atoms,

56
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,279
we're made of cells like we believe in all that stuff.

57
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:34,940
Yet,

58
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,320
somehow

59
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,919
here's how free will still like pops out of your brain

60
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,500
and do a lot of hand waving at that point.

61
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:45,059
Um So it's incredibly common view.

62
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,259
Um Like

63
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,500
all of our other features of our beliefs and temperaments,

64
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,279
um It's kind of context dependent

65
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:54,889
people really,

66
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:57,580
really are more likely to believe in free will

67
00:03:57,589 --> 00:04:01,369
if someone's complimenting them and saying good job,

68
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:02,770
they're really looking

69
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:09,410
like to like, likely to under circumstances where things have come up short. I mean,

70
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:13,990
there's, there's this classic dichotomy and sort of us, them thinking

71
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:18,589
that with them, when thems do something awful,

72
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:20,829
it's constitutional.

73
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,649
That's what they're like. They've always been like, they'll always be like,

74
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:29,100
and when one of us does something awful, it's situational.

75
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,890
Yeah, you have to understand they were under a lot of stress,

76
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:36,809
there were financial pressures, they had just been whatever, um,

77
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,250
as to how stable our us

78
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:41,559
this is

79
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,100
and we're often being pretty nasty when we're attributing

80
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,920
unchangeable

81
00:04:48,149 --> 00:04:49,309
them ness

82
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,339
to them.

83
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,950
Um, in that regard, we're very,

84
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,589
very malleable when it comes to how characteristically free

85
00:04:57,859 --> 00:05:03,040
we are. When things are going well, people believe in free will when

86
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,570
things are not,

87
00:05:04,579 --> 00:05:08,709
there's a tendency to go in the other direction but not in a globalized.

88
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,510
There's no free will whatsoever. Here's the extenuating circumstance

89
00:05:13,619 --> 00:05:19,529
that screwed me up just now that kept me from being the wondrous free,

90
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,359
consistent person that I am.

91
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,390
Yeah, something came up. But overall, overall we are the captains of our fate.

92
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:28,679
Mhm

93
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:36,019
But uh let me ask you about one criticism that perhaps many people,

94
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,950
scientists particularly would have

95
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:43,489
of uh your position. So we have a, a

96
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,690
good understanding or at least to some extent of the science of human behavior,

97
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,820
the factors that play a role there

98
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:55,760
uh from genetics to the environment and culture.

99
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,890
But uh I mean, there's still lots and lots of details that we are missing.

100
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:05,880
And it's really hard to be able to

101
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,640
predict with a very high level of accuracy how

102
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:15,619
people will behave in any particular point in time.

103
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:15,980
So,

104
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,799
the fact that there's

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,769
still fairly low predictability,

106
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:25,359
do you think that that's an argument against your position?

107
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,019
Um No, and that's, that's like a fantastic counter

108
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,040
ment to bring up because

109
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,880
it's very essential. It, it obviously is very essential. Um

110
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,500
Like I, I have sort of a hobby by now that I

111
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:45,730
uh help uh public defenders uh who

112
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,570
are lawyers defending poor people who can't afford

113
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:55,459
uh their own lawyers in murder cases for people who have a history of traumatic

114
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:01,049
childhoods, uh concussive head trauma and such teaching juries about the brain.

115
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,739
And what always happens is I get to do a two hour

116
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:06,019
presentation

117
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,989
and then the prosecuting attorney gets to cross examine me

118
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:13,579
and they always nail me on exactly these lines.

119
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:16,859
So, are you saying every single person

120
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:20,619
with this type of brain damage would do what this guy did?

121
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,429
I'd say, no,

122
00:07:22,549 --> 00:07:25,339
we can't say that. Could you have predicted this guy?

123
00:07:25,869 --> 00:07:27,250
No, we can't.

124
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:27,940
Um

125
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,619
Part of it, a

126
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:33,399
fundamentally deep response is

127
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,809
um

128
00:07:34,989 --> 00:07:36,359
when you look at

129
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,309
uh

130
00:07:37,739 --> 00:07:41,570
chaotic systems, systems that run on chaotic system,

131
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:47,160
like us, our brains, our cells, our molecules, our societies,

132
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,029
um

133
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:48,160
a

134
00:07:48,619 --> 00:07:52,390
critical thing about them is they are unpredictable.

135
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:58,149
They're still deterministic and lots of people mistake sort of chaotic

136
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,290
and the unpredictability of it as proof

137
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:04,500
that somehow we could transcend our molecules.

138
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,429
But on that level, in this very fundamental way, um

139
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,179
systems that are entirely deterministic

140
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:17,480
can nonetheless be completely unpredictable. A much more mundane answer is,

141
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:20,619
well, yeah, we're still finding out stuff.

142
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:26,700
And when you look at our knowledge about sort of the biology of human behavior,

143
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,579
like 99% of what we've learned about it has been in the last century,

144
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:39,580
75% has been in the last 50 years, 51% has been in the last decade,

145
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:44,650
25% of it has been since like we started this broadcast or whatever,

146
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:47,820
like the rate at which knowledge is pouring in

147
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,419
is incredibly fast. So there, there's this sort of indirect cheating

148
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:55,599
strategy that one can then say, which is

149
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,059
OK if we're all going to accept that tonight. At midnight. That's it.

150
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,429
Science is done.

151
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,799
We're never gonna find out anything new again.

152
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:06,599
This is everything we know at this point.

153
00:09:06,869 --> 00:09:07,700
The answer is, yeah.

154
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,739
Nonetheless, we can't predict a whole lot about human behavior.

155
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:16,179
Um But everything we know about the exponential increase in knowledge

156
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:18,299
is over and over and over,

157
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,210
we're gonna continue this pattern of saying,

158
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:22,239
oh,

159
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,080
I had no idea. Biology had something to do with that.

160
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:27,580
And

161
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,340
like you have a choice at this point,

162
00:09:30,349 --> 00:09:33,950
do you wanna be on the cutting edge of viewing that

163
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,409
we are nothing more or less than biological machines or do you

164
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:41,539
wanna be like the history of science example in a century of

165
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:45,309
just the primitiveness of what people still believed at the time.

166
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:51,789
And so one of the things uh also that people bring

167
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:56,960
to the table in discussions surrounding free will and that people use

168
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,690
in law and in the courtroom has to do with intent.

169
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:02,969
So,

170
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,820
from a scientific perspective,

171
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:10,119
what is intent exactly? And what do we know about it?

172
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:11,690
And do you think that

173
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:18,289
its intent in any way would make for a good case for

174
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,190
free will in any way?

175
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,530
Yes. Let me, let me just

176
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,849
be really uh sort of over the top here. Um As a scientist, my definition of intent

177
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,030
as a subject to consider when thinking about free will.

178
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,380
Um intent can be defined as boring as hell and totally irrelevant.

179
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,440
Um

180
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:47,049
OK. Why is that? Um the entire legal system, as you said, runs on that.

181
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:51,619
Um, when somebody did something awful, did they intend to do it?

182
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:55,340
And did they know that they had alternative options?

183
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,900
Um And did they understand what the consequences were going to be?

184
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:03,750
Um And if the answer to all of that is? Yeah, lock them up.

185
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,049
They intended to do what they did

186
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:09,479
and they knew there were alternatives. Um

187
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,570
And in sort of the neuroscience

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,190
world of free will where intent comes in is the most

189
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,580
influential crazy making experiment of all time in the field.

190
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:26,150
This is something that came in the early 19 eighties by a man named Benjamin Lit.

191
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:31,010
And you read any paper about the biology of free will

192
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,210
and like the person is almost required by law to mention lit

193
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:39,419
by the second paragraph, these were these amazing studies. He took people

194
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:43,140
and wired them up with sort of electroencephalograms,

195
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:46,400
eegs to record brain activity in different areas.

196
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:50,070
This was like Neanderthal era technology at the time,

197
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,739
you couldn't do brain imaging then.

198
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,239
But this very simple approach. Um

199
00:11:54,669 --> 00:11:56,830
he said to people,

200
00:11:56,989 --> 00:11:59,219
OK, whenever you want,

201
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,630
press this button

202
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,010
and they had things to tell when the pressing process actually

203
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,190
started by seeing when muscles started constricting in his arm.

204
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,330
And they could see what was happening in the motor cortex,

205
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:18,489
the part of the brain telling those muscles and they could see the parts of the brain

206
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,309
that would tell another part to tell another part to tell the motor cortex to do that.

207
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,239
And the earth shattering finding that he came up with was all

208
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,239
of this playing out in about a half second or so.

209
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:36,940
You could tell when the brain had decided it was time to press the button

210
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,500
because before the person was conscious of their intention to do it

211
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:46,729
by about 200 milliseconds, 2/10 of a second.

212
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,130
And oh my God,

213
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:54,929
your brain has decided before you were conscious of intending to do this.

214
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,049
And

215
00:12:56,369 --> 00:13:00,770
everyone like went crazy over this because this is just proven

216
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,580
there was no free will until like people started arguing about.

217
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,059
When do you become aware of intention?

218
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,239
And is that different from when you intend to do something? And,

219
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,960
and you know, all this philosophical stuff of,

220
00:13:15,969 --> 00:13:19,119
is there a difference between intending to do something

221
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,299
and intending to stop yourself from doing something?

222
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,380
The difference between free will and free won't?

223
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:29,599
And they're still fighting about this. This is 40 years later

224
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:35,190
for a scientist, there was like a paper a couple of years ago entitled like Livid.

225
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,590
Had no idea what he was talking about or,

226
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:41,109
or something slightly more like formal than that

227
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,030
for people to still be telling you that your

228
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,630
science was wrong 40 years after you did it,

229
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,150
this is like immortality for a scientist.

230
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:55,070
They're still fighting about what this finding means. Does your brain

231
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,059
know that you're intending to do something before you're consciously aware of it.

232
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:06,820
And I scream every time I see yet another one of these studies because as I said,

233
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,799
it's boring as hell and totally irrelevant.

234
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:13,150
And in a courtroom as well, did this person intend to do that?

235
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:19,010
Because none of it asks the only relevant question there is. Oh, yeah.

236
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:21,719
Where did that intent come from?

237
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,919
Where did it come from in the first place?

238
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,849
Because to answer the question of,

239
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,219
did the brain

240
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,109
have intent before you did that's playing out in 2/10 of a second

241
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,729
when you're asking, where did that intent come from?

242
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:42,849
What does that have to do with what was going on in your brain one second ago?

243
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,169
And what was happening in the environment one minute ago?

244
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:50,950
And what hormone levels were like one day ago and

245
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,770
how traumatic or stimulating the previous one year had been

246
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:57,609
and what your adolescence was like in your childhood

247
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:00,210
and your fetal life and your genes and the

248
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:04,609
culture your ancestors invented because that influenced how your

249
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:07,330
mother was raising you within a minute of birth.

250
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,369
Where did that intent come from?

251
00:15:09,859 --> 00:15:14,059
And the metaphor I use in the book is deciding whether or not

252
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:19,080
there's free will based on what's going on in that last half second

253
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:23,950
and only knowing what the intent was is like deciding whether you like

254
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,700
a movie or not by just having seen the final three minutes of it

255
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:30,479
because you've missed everything.

256
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:35,880
It doesn't matter if the person intended to or not. Where did that intent come from?

257
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,570
And that's

258
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,400
where the legal system

259
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:43,320
falls apart in terms of their thinking about,

260
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:45,619
you know, punishment and blame.

261
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,219
And that's where most thinking about whether or

262
00:15:49,229 --> 00:15:51,919
not there's free will falls apart because everybody is

263
00:15:51,929 --> 00:15:54,580
just interested in their brain imaging studies telling

264
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,109
you what happened in the last three milliseconds.

265
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,080
And that tells you nothing

266
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:03,359
because something about what happened to you this morning

267
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,049
had something to do with it.

268
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:08,809
Something about your fetal life had something to do with it.

269
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:14,289
Something about the culture, your answer came up with 500 years ago,

270
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:15,700
had something to do with it.

271
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,900
And when you look at all those pieces from one second

272
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:22,690
before to millennia before and you put all those pieces together,

273
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,450
there's not a damn inch in there to shoehorn in an

274
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:31,090
ocean of free will operating independent of all of that stuff.

275
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,369
Mhm

276
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,489
So when it comes to behavioral science,

277
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:43,270
we always hear about nature versus nurture genes, the environment

278
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,919
does when it comes to free will specifically, does it matter at all

279
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:50,650
if uh

280
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:57,580
we're talking about uh for example, biological factors or environmental factors?

281
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:57,929
I mean,

282
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:01,650
do we have any more control, for example,

283
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:06,290
over our environment and how it affects our behavior

284
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:09,770
than we have over our gyms,

285
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:10,608
-- for
-- example,

286
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,199
zero in both cases in the fundamental ways.

287
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,260
I mean, what one is obliged to do in my business at this point is saying,

288
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:25,689
nature and nurture always interact and you can't pull them apart and asking which

289
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:31,819
contributes more is like what's contributing more to the area of this rectangle,

290
00:17:31,829 --> 00:17:35,079
the length or the width they always interact and

291
00:17:35,239 --> 00:17:38,780
that sort of thing um within this realm. Um

292
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:46,369
The summary I would get at is we are nothing more or less than the sum of our biology,

293
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:52,459
which we had no control over and its interactions with the sum of our environment

294
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,790
over which we had no control over.

295
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,979
And they're completely inseparable.

296
00:17:57,989 --> 00:18:00,750
I mean, it's the simplest example of like, oh,

297
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,400
how important was environment in this sort

298
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,729
of case and its interaction with biology?

299
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:12,589
Wow, what explains the fact that I'm sitting here right now and have

300
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,339
a occupation that carries some prestige and westernized culture

301
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:19,300
and all of that, what did environment have to do with it?

302
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:22,310
Starting with environment prenatal environment.

303
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:27,869
The fact that my, my mother was not suffering from malaria or

304
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,339
Chagas disease or like any such thing and wasn't protein

305
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:36,189
starved because she was a nomadic pastoralist in the Sahel,

306
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:37,099
in Africa.

307
00:18:37,109 --> 00:18:37,560
And like,

308
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:43,219
oh, like we're talking like at that level already. That's like what we're talking

309
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:45,699
already at that level.

310
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:53,180
That's part of the brain that you wound up being uh handed to you here in adulthood.

311
00:18:53,229 --> 00:18:57,660
Um All of that stuff matters and it's inseparable.

312
00:18:58,859 --> 00:18:59,339
Mhm

313
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,719
One very interesting thing that you talk about in the

314
00:19:02,729 --> 00:19:08,229
book is the Behavioral Science slash Biology of luck.

315
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:10,400
What is that about

316
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:12,199
it? It's, that's

317
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:14,550
ultimately everything,

318
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,609
everything we're talking about here.

319
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,530
Um

320
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,369
Another way of saying, oh,

321
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,839
the sum of our biology and this interaction with the sum of our

322
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:28,420
environment is we are nothing more or less than the outcome of our luck

323
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,569
and anyone who claims

324
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,589
otherwise that

325
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:40,449
they earned their good luck or that it makes sense to punish them for their bad luck.

326
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:41,359
Um

327
00:19:41,709 --> 00:19:42,839
All we are

328
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:49,109
is the outcome of biology, interacting with environment in the context of luck.

329
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,180
And there's this whole thing like child development, um try to make sense of

330
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,619
who turns out to be like the the

331
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,770
violent adults and the drug addicts and all the,

332
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:07,780
all the bad outcomes and like no surprise childhood has a huge amount to do with it

333
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,140
and it's been formalized into this thing.

334
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,060
Um At least in sort of uh United States called your

335
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:21,839
ace score A ce the sum of your adverse childhood experiences.

336
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:29,099
And there's this ace like questionnaire scoring system where you can get from 0 to 10

337
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,520
and zero is you had no adversity 10 is like you

338
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:37,329
had all of the following 10 horrible things happen to you.

339
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,449
Were you

340
00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:41,910
a witness to physical violence

341
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:44,329
or psychological violence at home?

342
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:49,839
Were you a victim of physical violence or psychological violence?

343
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:54,560
Were you a victim of sexual abuse? Were you in a broken family?

344
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:57,500
Was there a weapon at home when you was there,

345
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:02,839
a family member who was incarcerated this whole list there going from 0 to 10.

346
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:07,160
Um, and what you see is for every single step,

347
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:11,040
every point you add to somebody's ace score.

348
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,069
Um, there's about a 35% increased likelihood

349
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,979
that they're going to be involved in violent

350
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:21,170
antisocial behavior by the time they're adult.

351
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:22,359
If they're a male,

352
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:28,229
there's about a 35% increased chance that they're gonna have a teenage pregnancy.

353
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,660
If they're female,

354
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,349
about a 35% increased chance of either that they're gonna have

355
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,290
substance abuse and addiction problems every step in the way.

356
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:40,910
And this is one way of formalizing like this

357
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,770
is the quantified science of shitty luck in childhood.

358
00:21:45,979 --> 00:21:49,670
And it has always struck me that at the same time. Instead of making it

359
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:53,579
an adverse childhood experience score,

360
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:58,869
you could make a ridiculously lucky childhood experience score.

361
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,910
Did your

362
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:03,599
parent or parents read books to you?

363
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:09,369
Did you have a stable income? Um Did you never have to worry about food?

364
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,199
Did you play games and laugh at home? Whatever?

365
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,609
Come up with a score of that and it's gonna tell you forever.

366
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:16,770
Each step in those,

367
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:22,479
there's a 35% increase that you're gonna be working a prestigious white

368
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:27,910
collar job someday and have an office and a secretary or who knows

369
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,989
just a different way of explaining the same thing.

370
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:31,869
Um

371
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,469
Everything that we frame as morality is instead the outcome or of good or bad luck.

372
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:47,209
And we have built a world in which we punish or reward people

373
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,979
over the luck they had nothing to do with.

374
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,589
Mhm.

375
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:57,290
But, uh, as we go through, uh childhood adolescence,

376
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,859
adulthood and our prefrontal cortices develop,

377
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:08,280
we tend to gain or acquire more self-control, more impulse control.

378
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:15,119
Does that not count at least as a few more degrees of rhythm?

379
00:23:15,739 --> 00:23:16,310
Right.

380
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,400
Let's look at the sentence you just said as we get older, don't we acquire

381
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:26,510
more frontal cortical self control? What does acquire mean?

382
00:23:27,229 --> 00:23:30,650
It means you're lucky enough to be in an environment

383
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,170
that would have taught you that

384
00:23:32,689 --> 00:23:35,660
it means you're lucky enough to have a brain at

385
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:39,130
that point where you could learn from those experiences.

386
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,099
It means that you're lucky enough that the counter examples every day

387
00:23:43,109 --> 00:23:46,170
when you finish school and went outside and there was the,

388
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,170
your gang telling you let's go rob that liquor store.

389
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,810
Um Let's do something impulsive that reinforces

390
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:56,250
your frontal cortex not working very well.

391
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:59,729
How many of those were going on at the end of the day?

392
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:03,969
Do you go home and you're bullied by somebody at home and anything

393
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:07,939
you heard during the day about like the wonderful path ahead of you?

394
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:11,170
Thanks to self control goes out the window. Be

395
00:24:11,959 --> 00:24:12,579
Yeah,

396
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,459
we learned. Oh, wow.

397
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:20,540
Didn't you learn somewhere along the way that self control is a bad thing for you if

398
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:23,619
you're a fetus and your mother is very

399
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,979
stressed and secreting a lot of stress hormones.

400
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:28,680
You're going to be born with a

401
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:32,109
frontal cortex that's already less developed than average

402
00:24:32,214 --> 00:24:32,255
and

403
00:24:32,364 --> 00:24:33,314
newborns.

404
00:24:33,324 --> 00:24:35,655
Meaning 15 years later,

405
00:24:35,665 --> 00:24:39,675
you're getting great lessons in life about the importance of self control.

406
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:45,415
And by the time you were a damn fetus, you were already less likely than average

407
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:51,255
to be able to learn those lessons and benefit from them every step along the way.

408
00:24:51,704 --> 00:24:55,244
Where did that intent come from? Where did that learning come from?

409
00:24:55,265 --> 00:24:58,094
Where did the opportunity for that learning come from?

410
00:24:58,489 --> 00:25:00,910
And it's always, you know,

411
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:05,430
all that stuff that brought you to this moment over which you had no control.

412
00:25:07,219 --> 00:25:12,790
And when it comes to our psychological traits, we know, for example,

413
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,680
from disciplines like behavior genetics that there's the role of genes and then the

414
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,000
shared environment, the non shared environment,

415
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,400
unique experiences we go through.

416
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:29,030
Isn't there any space at all there for some,

417
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:36,500
uh I mean, for us to have some sort of be, be able to play some active role

418
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,290
in the kind of person that we're going to become?

419
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:42,910
Absolutely.

420
00:25:43,229 --> 00:25:46,819
Um And that's one of the ways in which

421
00:25:47,209 --> 00:25:51,469
uh people should avoid the hysteria of deciding genes,

422
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:55,109
determine everything that genes are the most interesting things.

423
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,410
If nothing else, you have this whole field of epigenetics,

424
00:25:58,439 --> 00:26:00,469
the ways in which experience

425
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:01,770
can change

426
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,969
how readily genes of yours are turned on or off.

427
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:07,630
For the rest of your life in some cases. OK.

428
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,969
So we're moved away from a genetic deterministic picture for a zillion reasons,

429
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:14,349
uh both biological and environmental.

430
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:17,729
Um But you're saying, can't we choose

431
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,719
to take an action

432
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:24,680
to take a conscious action which will change our destiny?

433
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:27,119
And the answer is

434
00:26:27,329 --> 00:26:28,800
not in the slightest,

435
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,550
you look at two people who were given an opportunity

436
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:38,280
and one is this person who every single split in the road,

437
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,949
they always take the wrong direction.

438
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:46,939
They never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity at everyone. You could have.

439
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:47,579
They,

440
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,640
they would have given you that job. They were offering you a scholarship.

441
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:57,310
The guy said you didn't have to drive the car when they were going to do the robbery and

442
00:26:57,479 --> 00:27:01,640
oh my God, every time that person makes the wrong choice,

443
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:06,189
every time they come up with the wrong intent

444
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:12,849
and where did that come from? And when we seemingly have made a major

445
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,209
decision

446
00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:15,890
on our part

447
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,400
about something in life, are you

448
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:23,699
going to rob the store? Are you going to study hard?

449
00:27:23,709 --> 00:27:28,699
Are you gonna propose marriage to this person or you? Who knows what? Um

450
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,459
And that feels intent.

451
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,010
Um

452
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:35,140
Everything about the biology and this interaction

453
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,160
with the environment that came before that

454
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:39,979
is what brought you to that moment.

455
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:42,880
Like from everything.

456
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:45,540
Like if you're hungry,

457
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:49,770
you're more likely to commit an antisocial violent act.

458
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:57,170
If somebody smells good to you, their pheromones, you're more likely to find them.

459
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,010
You claim that they are more vis

460
00:27:59,209 --> 00:28:01,380
visually physically attractive if you,

461
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,119
you know all this stuff, what,

462
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,510
what

463
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,000
this,

464
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:09,319
at the split in the road? Do you make the right decision or not?

465
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,920
What this taps into is? I think

466
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:14,569
the most pernicious way in

467
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,000
which people hold on to. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

468
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:21,979
There's biology and we have brains and all of that and it just made a brain gunk.

469
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:27,479
Um, but we have free will, we have free will. Is this dichotomy people bring in?

470
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:29,969
You look at somebody

471
00:28:30,449 --> 00:28:33,729
who's 7 ft four and of course,

472
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:37,270
they're a great basketball player or you look at somebody

473
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,979
and they have particular ratio of slow twitch to fast

474
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:45,459
twitch fibers in their leg muscles and of course they

475
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:48,849
turn out to be a good marathoner or maybe even

476
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,900
you understand enough about receptors for this or that neurotransmitter.

477
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,180
And of course they have a good memory or good. Any of these.

478
00:28:58,189 --> 00:29:02,000
We're pretty good at accepting the biology

479
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,630
of what our natural attributes are.

480
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:09,160
Some people have lovely voices and others don't.

481
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,079
And they're never gonna sing in an opera.

482
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:16,400
Some people have, yes, there's these natural attributes. OK. Ok. Ok.

483
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,949
Science biology has something to do with that.

484
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:25,170
But oh, where free will comes in is what you do with your attributes?

485
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,959
Do you squander them? Do you work hard to overcome your limitations?

486
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:31,589
Do you,

487
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:33,489
are you one of these people like you go

488
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,209
on youtube and there's unbelievable examples of this,

489
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:41,560
of like marathoners and like important races where they collapse

490
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:45,719
53 ft from the finish line and they crawl,

491
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:47,839
they crawl to the very end.

492
00:29:47,949 --> 00:29:54,439
And you say, oh my God, this is amazing with what they did with what they were given.

493
00:29:54,449 --> 00:29:57,280
Or you find like somebody raised in poverty in a

494
00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,199
horrible neighborhood and all of that who somehow winds up

495
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,180
like with their Nobel Prize at the other end,

496
00:30:04,189 --> 00:30:08,010
or somebody who grows up in great wealth and privilege and

497
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,410
they're a junkie by the time they're 20

498
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:12,109
they've spent half their fortune.

499
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:13,180
Oh,

500
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,040
your attributes

501
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,319
you have no control over. That's the biology.

502
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,349
What do you do with the attributes?

503
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:23,010
That's where we have a world of,

504
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,329
oh, what a self

505
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:26,209
indulgent squander.

506
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:30,640
What an inspiring role model, how they worked to overcome.

507
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,989
There's something in there

508
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:37,050
that we believe that things like your memory

509
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:41,670
or whether you have perfect pitch or things like that are made of biology

510
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:49,150
and how hard you work and your self control and how indulgent you are and all of that

511
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:54,209
somehow that's made of other stuff that's not made of biology.

512
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,189
And when you look at it like what happened to you as a fetus

513
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:02,400
is going to have something to do with the construction of your part of the brain

514
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:06,250
that has something to do with whether it splits in the road,

515
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,040
you always make the bad decision,

516
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:12,920
you every step of this is biology as well.

517
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:17,859
Um But there's this very strong emotional pull

518
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:21,660
to differentiate between the two

519
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,439
and

520
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:28,459
willpower and backbone and fortitude and all of that,

521
00:31:28,699 --> 00:31:33,569
that's the stuff we admire because that's the true measure of who somebody is

522
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,599
independent of their neurons and molecules of it's made of the same stuff.

523
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,670
And so um is there any space for

524
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:50,119
an idea like meritocracy in this sort of deterministic

525
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:54,589
world? I mean, if someone just so happens to have

526
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:58,510
the psychological traits that tend to correlate with success,

527
00:31:58,729 --> 00:32:05,300
for example, in industrialized societies, like greed, conscientiousness,

528
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,479
high intelligence and so on.

529
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:08,560
Should we at

530
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,969
from, from a scientific perspective?

531
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:13,839
Of course, I'm not talking about uh philosophy,

532
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,290
a philosophical perspective nor any of that.

533
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,739
Does it make sense to attribute any personal merit to them?

534
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,069
Yeah.

535
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:22,989
Um

536
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:25,989
The only possible,

537
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:35,069
scientifically acceptable and morally acceptable conclusion from all of this is

538
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:39,369
there's no circumstance in which blame and punishment

539
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:43,030
make moral sense or are

540
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,099
uh are good things in and of themselves.

541
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,280
And likewise,

542
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:53,719
there's no circumstance in which praise and reward are virtues in

543
00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:57,390
and of themselves because nobody earned one or the other,

544
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,270
that sort of thing.

545
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,359
This comes with two provisos though

546
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,140
um

547
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,380
the first one is

548
00:33:05,459 --> 00:33:07,390
like every now and then

549
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:12,359
it's useful to punish someone because it changes their behavior in an effective

550
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:18,420
way or it's useful to praise somebody because in an instrumental sense.

551
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:18,849
Um

552
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:22,170
Praise and blame could be useful,

553
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,180
not because of what somebody did in the past that this is retribute but

554
00:33:26,189 --> 00:33:28,630
for shaping their future behavior just in

555
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,770
like a psychological engineering kind of way.

556
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:34,609
Um So that's not saying it's not possible,

557
00:33:34,829 --> 00:33:36,540
it's never useful, but

558
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,689
just as another way of

559
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:43,329
influence the influencing the biological machine.

560
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,489
Um The more fundamental level is

561
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:53,880
when you say crazy stuff like I just did to people they say,

562
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:54,800
oh,

563
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:58,500
so you want just murderers running around the streets

564
00:33:58,819 --> 00:33:59,420
or?

565
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,030
Oh,

566
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,060
you just want it randomly picked who's going to

567
00:34:03,069 --> 00:34:05,859
do brain surgery to take out your tumor.

568
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,520
No, of course not.

569
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:12,458
Even if you get rid of the entire criminal justice system

570
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,310
as it now appears.

571
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,820
And as we should,

572
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:21,129
because it's built on biological nonsense of the most destructive kind.

573
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,250
Nonetheless,

574
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,659
people who are uncontrollably dangerous and violent where you can't fix them,

575
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:28,820
you gotta protect people from them.

576
00:34:29,188 --> 00:34:32,908
Um, a car whose brakes don't work.

577
00:34:33,018 --> 00:34:36,789
You don't let it out on the street, you put it in the garage and you like,

578
00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:37,748
don't drive it,

579
00:34:37,888 --> 00:34:42,447
but you don't preach to either that violent person

580
00:34:42,549 --> 00:34:45,668
or to the car whose brakes don't work that they have a

581
00:34:45,678 --> 00:34:50,329
crummy rotten soul and they don't deserve to be able to do this

582
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:56,717
and what you have to do instead is use a term that's more and more in like this.

583
00:34:57,129 --> 00:35:00,310
People thinking this way is they have to be quarantined,

584
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,229
quarantine them so that they're not dangerous to anyone and not an inch more.

585
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:08,310
And not because there's anything about it that

586
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,030
they deserve the brakes don't work on their car

587
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:15,100
and then the flip side is exactly the same. Oh, my God.

588
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:19,229
So, what, we should just have a random lottery as to who,

589
00:35:19,389 --> 00:35:21,419
who, like,

590
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:25,050
does brain surgery on you. No, of course not.

591
00:35:25,149 --> 00:35:28,550
Just as you can't have dangerous people on the street,

592
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:32,209
You need the most competent people out there

593
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:34,899
doing the medicine, doing the

594
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,860
legal stuff, writing whatever it is that takes

595
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,739
um skill

596
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,860
that matters,

597
00:35:42,489 --> 00:35:43,850
that's really important.

598
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,620
But

599
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,739
you just the same,

600
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:51,790
you can't sit there and tell that person because they have a wonderful soul or

601
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,939
a wonderful self discipline or whatever that they

602
00:35:54,949 --> 00:35:57,889
deserve to have this ridiculously large income.

603
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,020
Like

604
00:35:59,139 --> 00:36:04,100
a world built around blaming people for their antisocial behavior

605
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:05,590
makes no sense.

606
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,370
And a world built around rewarding people for their

607
00:36:08,379 --> 00:36:12,379
prosocial behavior or their expertise makes no sense either.

608
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,459
Um And is ultimately

609
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,419
just as morally

610
00:36:18,459 --> 00:36:19,360
corrupt

611
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:23,560
because if you say you are a brain surgeon

612
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:26,679
and getting enormous societal prestige

613
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,780
because you did something where you earned it, you deserve to do that

614
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:36,060
and be in that position makes as little sense biologically as saying

615
00:36:36,409 --> 00:36:37,129
the brain,

616
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:40,560
the uh the murderer with a history of frontal cortical

617
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,959
damage deserves to be in prison all of that.

618
00:36:43,229 --> 00:36:45,479
Um Yeah, it's the flip side.

619
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,000
A meritocracy makes no sense. A

620
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:53,429
justice system built around retribution makes no sense either.

621
00:36:53,459 --> 00:36:57,860
But at the same time, dangerous people should not be allowed to damage people.

622
00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:00,570
And competent people should be more likely to

623
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,139
be running the world than less competent people.

624
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,870
But no one should feel shame or pride

625
00:37:07,669 --> 00:37:09,189
for which end of those Katina

626
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,500
they wind up on.

627
00:37:12,459 --> 00:37:16,830
But even if there's not really space for

628
00:37:17,149 --> 00:37:20,800
blame or praise or to consider

629
00:37:20,979 --> 00:37:25,719
or to think that someone is responsible for their own actions,

630
00:37:25,919 --> 00:37:31,050
do you think that it would still make sense to talk about punishment?

631
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,360
At least as a deterrence measure

632
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,800
or for example,

633
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:43,070
blaming or praising someone just because we know scientifically that if we do that,

634
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:47,229
we would be disincentivizing bad behavior,

635
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:52,679
incentivizing good behavior and conditioning people to behave in

636
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,409
better ways.

637
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:55,810
Absolutely.

638
00:37:55,979 --> 00:37:56,719
And

639
00:37:57,050 --> 00:38:00,229
it's the same biology that like you take a,

640
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:07,169
a sea snail and it could learn that when you like bop it on the head with a pencil,

641
00:38:07,179 --> 00:38:08,989
it retracts its

642
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,780
gill mechanism or some.

643
00:38:10,939 --> 00:38:11,489
Yeah,

644
00:38:11,709 --> 00:38:13,350
you can shape

645
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:16,860
sea snails behavior, you could shape human behavior,

646
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:21,209
you could shape human behavior to be more or less adaptive, blah, blah, all of that.

647
00:38:21,219 --> 00:38:21,550
And

648
00:38:21,729 --> 00:38:21,919
yeah.

649
00:38:22,004 --> 00:38:22,104
Yeah,

650
00:38:22,114 --> 00:38:27,264
sometimes it requires punishment and sometimes it requires praise and reward.

651
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:28,544
Um But

652
00:38:28,725 --> 00:38:30,024
just because

653
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:33,425
that's like another thing you can do,

654
00:38:33,554 --> 00:38:34,854
sometimes

655
00:38:34,975 --> 00:38:38,145
intervene with somebody who's got problems and

656
00:38:38,304 --> 00:38:43,044
make sure they uh they get enough calories in their diet

657
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:48,409
and things will go better sometimes like you hit someone over the head and say they,

658
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:52,250
they can't do this anymore and they'll stop doing some rotten behavior.

659
00:38:52,379 --> 00:38:53,040
Yes.

660
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:58,229
But never with a sense that you are doing a moral good

661
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:00,860
because that's completely irrelevant.

662
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:03,580
It's just another realm in which

663
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:08,699
we as biological machines can be shaped in our behavior.

664
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:17,479
And what do you think about, uh, the idea that some people put forth that, uh, ok,

665
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:21,949
even if we know that free will does not exist

666
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:24,629
that it doesn't make sense to talk about free will.

667
00:39:25,389 --> 00:39:30,090
People should still believe in free will because if they don't,

668
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,929
they will be

669
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:37,659
worse people. I mean, do you, or do you think on the other hand that, uh,

670
00:39:37,979 --> 00:39:40,399
telling people that,

671
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:40,540
uh,

672
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:47,250
they should abandon their belief in free will would actually improve their lives?

673
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,610
Ok. This is, this is ultimately like

674
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:54,979
the most important question to ask whether or not we have free will.

675
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:56,620
Should we all believe that we do?

676
00:39:56,889 --> 00:39:57,459
Um,

677
00:39:57,689 --> 00:40:02,580
one worry which you bring up is if we stop believing in free will,

678
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:07,500
we're all gonna become murderers and cheats and liars and we will run amok.

679
00:40:07,584 --> 00:40:11,584
Um And this is the thing people worry about,

680
00:40:11,824 --> 00:40:17,685
uh, most instantly and there's a cruel experimental psychology literature

681
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:23,715
showing that if you take like volunteer test subjects and you manipulate them

682
00:40:23,975 --> 00:40:28,304
into feeling like there is less free will than they thought there was

683
00:40:28,495 --> 00:40:32,485
10 minutes later, they're more likely to cheat on a test,

684
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:35,844
they're more likely to do something crummy to somebody else.

685
00:40:35,854 --> 00:40:37,084
When they're playing a game,

686
00:40:37,379 --> 00:40:41,080
morality and ethical behavior goes down.

687
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,040
That's it. That's exactly what,

688
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:47,770
like the problem is when you tell people, um,

689
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,100
like you can't be held responsible for anything.

690
00:40:51,209 --> 00:40:51,790
They've run

691
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,379
amok.

692
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:55,209
Just like if you convince someone that there

693
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,939
is no God and thus there's no punishment,

694
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,439
they run amok also.

695
00:41:00,189 --> 00:41:02,639
And then you look closer at it

696
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,830
and because there's this parallel literature, you

697
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:11,760
have test subjects and you convince them, manipulate them into believing,

698
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:16,629
lesson God and right afterward, they cheat more and they do the same crummy stuff.

699
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:20,250
But now you do a different version of these studies,

700
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:26,110
get someone who comes in and says, I haven't believed in free will for 10 years

701
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:31,270
or I haven't believed in God since I was a teenager or any.

702
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:34,719
You get people who have thought that way and felt

703
00:41:34,729 --> 00:41:37,600
that way for a long time who got there.

704
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:40,939
Not because some like psychology professor

705
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:43,030
is manipulating them in this environment.

706
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:44,939
But you get people like that

707
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:51,840
who've thought through this for a long time. And they are exactly as moral

708
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,100
as the most religious people and the people with

709
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,370
the strongest sense of belief in free will.

710
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,429
And this fascinates me,

711
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,179
like in terms of the God issue,

712
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:07,500
you look at people who very, very strongly believe in God

713
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:08,780
and the whole

714
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:14,379
show that goes along with that or very, very strongly believes there is no God.

715
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:15,290
And as I said,

716
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:18,949
there's no difference in their levels of ethical behavior

717
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:25,560
and it's very high in both cases who are the ones who are less ethical,

718
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,250
the ones who are in between,

719
00:42:27,409 --> 00:42:29,500
the ones who say, oh, I don't know,

720
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:31,830
I guess there's God and like,

721
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,870
I make sure the kids learn something about it because it's good for them and like,

722
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:36,510
the, the ho

723
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:40,850
are good or say God, I don't, I don't actually care.

724
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:44,040
Maybe there's not a God, but it's like, what does it have to do with me?

725
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:46,489
The people who are like

726
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:52,350
indifferently religious or apathetically atheistic, the ones in the middle,

727
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:56,590
those are the ones who you readily manipulate their moral behavior,

728
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,179
one direction or the other.

729
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,830
If you've spent a hell of a long time sitting and thinking about

730
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:08,120
the root of human goodness and evil and what we owe our

731
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:13,139
fellow humans and is their purpose in life that transcends us.

732
00:43:13,189 --> 00:43:17,620
It doesn't really matter if your conclusion is there is a God or there

733
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:22,750
is no God or we're free agents or we have no free will whatsoever.

734
00:43:22,939 --> 00:43:25,860
You're one of the ones who thought long and hard about it

735
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:30,830
and both sets of conclusions you come out as being more ethically

736
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:31,889
moral

737
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,830
than your average person.

738
00:43:34,129 --> 00:43:34,780
Um

739
00:43:34,889 --> 00:43:37,959
So people are not going to run amok

740
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,540
if they are raised from the very beginning

741
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:45,780
to think this is not a world where it is fair. To blame anyone

742
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:50,300
and I don't deserve to get this or that reward more than anyone else.

743
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,760
They're going to be past the notion. Oh,

744
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,729
no one's gonna hold me responsible. I can go and stab the old lady

745
00:43:58,919 --> 00:44:03,419
there with any luck to be past that by the time they're like, 20 years old.

746
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:10,689
And I was here hearing all the time people saying that

747
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:17,459
hard determinist were all nihilists and atheists and they were all the time,

748
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:23,750
-- uh, pillaging and raping and murdering people.
-- Exactly. Because that's,

749
00:44:23,899 --> 00:44:25,879
that's the logical first thing.

750
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,199
Um, the logical second thing that was also, went back

751
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,080
in your question is when you get past, oh,

752
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:38,370
should I run amok and do whatever I want all of that is, should I get depressed as hell?

753
00:44:38,399 --> 00:44:41,239
Because there's no purpose to any of this?

754
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:45,870
There's this huge existential void out there.

755
00:44:45,899 --> 00:44:50,719
Should I like, is this terrible thing to have people believe

756
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:53,909
in terms of their mental health and stuff? Um,

757
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:55,419
and a point,

758
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:56,570
like,

759
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,399
it took me five years to write this book and the 1st 4.5

760
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:04,310
years I was thinking the answer to that was gonna have to be.

761
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:07,199
Yeah. And that sucks. And it's awful.

762
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:10,520
But, you know, that's how things work and, like, come on,

763
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,600
we need to be adults and face reality

764
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,520
and it finally struck me

765
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,979
the much more meaningful answer to it,

766
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,469
which is, if you are convinced there's no free will

767
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:26,850
and you get totally depressed and empty

768
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,199
void because it means your accomplishments.

769
00:45:30,209 --> 00:45:32,159
You didn't really earn that.

770
00:45:32,169 --> 00:45:35,679
The people who loved you don't really love you for who you are.

771
00:45:35,689 --> 00:45:41,449
But for biological stuff that you helped this old woman cross the street just now.

772
00:45:41,459 --> 00:45:45,560
Not because you're a good person, but because that's how you function as machine.

773
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:45,909
All that.

774
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:50,919
Oh my God. This is so depressing. If that's your response,

775
00:45:51,479 --> 00:45:53,310
you're one of the lucky ones.

776
00:45:54,139 --> 00:45:57,439
You've got the luck and privilege to sit there and say,

777
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,580
oh my God, maybe I really didn't earn my wonderful university degree.

778
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:03,760
Oh my God.

779
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:08,770
Maybe I didn't really deserve to be liked by people because of my personality.

780
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:12,959
If you're someone who has spent your whole life paying the price of

781
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:15,159
your parents, poverty

782
00:46:15,879 --> 00:46:16,580
or

783
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,310
the fact that you don't have an attractive face or the fact that you have

784
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,580
the genes that deep predispose you towards

785
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:27,280
obesity and people recoil from overweight people.

786
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,320
Or because you turned out not to be so smart or

787
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:33,679
it turns out you can't control your behavior because of biology.

788
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:37,260
All that getting rid of the free will concept does

789
00:46:37,649 --> 00:46:39,080
is be liberating.

790
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:45,090
You don't have a shitty soul because your life has not turned out that well.

791
00:46:45,229 --> 00:46:46,860
And for most people,

792
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:51,659
that's the much more important outcome to all of this than deciding, oh,

793
00:46:51,669 --> 00:46:55,489
I guess I really didn't earn my million dollars to be a millionaire.

794
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,840
Um, for most people

795
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,179
getting rid of the concept of free will is

796
00:47:01,189 --> 00:47:04,199
not gonna make us like crazy and nihilistic.

797
00:47:04,229 --> 00:47:06,219
Um It's gonna be liberating.

798
00:47:07,939 --> 00:47:08,479
Mhm

799
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:14,100
But uh going back just for a second to one of the initial

800
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:17,679
points I brought to the table when it comes to the fact that

801
00:47:17,889 --> 00:47:21,489
we do not yet have a complete science of

802
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,719
human behavior and we cannot 100% predict how someone

803
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:29,530
will behave in a particular situation.

804
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:30,479
Uh

805
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:36,860
What if someone heard your arguments of behavioral scientist and said, oh OK, Dr

806
00:47:37,459 --> 00:47:41,419
Sapolsky, your arguments are great, the science is awesome. But

807
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:46,939
since we still do not have a complete picture of human behavior,

808
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:51,689
at least for the time being, I will refrain from making

809
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:57,195
absolute claims, uh claims regarding free will. I will wait and see.

810
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:57,784
I mean,

811
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:01,824
basically what I'm asking you is do you think that the fact

812
00:48:01,834 --> 00:48:05,945
that we do not yet have a complete science of free will

813
00:48:06,054 --> 00:48:12,314
uh would make uh such a claim that we should reframe, refrain from making

814
00:48:12,574 --> 00:48:18,425
-- such absolute claims about free will uh make
-- sense, right? Um

815
00:48:19,909 --> 00:48:22,000
Two types of answers there.

816
00:48:22,459 --> 00:48:23,879
The first one is

817
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:24,780
um

818
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:25,570
yeah,

819
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,840
it's gonna be so hard to subtract out thinking there's free

820
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:32,290
will because we don't have the solid scientific facts yet.

821
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,610
For centuries,

822
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:38,050
all we've done over and over is figure out that responsibility

823
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:41,449
turns out not to have something to do with our behavior.

824
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:46,010
Turns out hailstorms are not caused by witches,

825
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:52,169
it turns out people who have epileptic seizures are not possessed by Satan

826
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,899
or even

827
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:57,909
within the last 50 years or so. It turns out

828
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,719
people come down with the disease.

829
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:05,969
Schizophrenia, not because their mothers were psycho dynamically,

830
00:49:05,979 --> 00:49:08,070
monsters who hated them.

831
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,399
And all that happened at each one of those points is

832
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:15,129
you tell the mothers of,

833
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,330
you know, hundreds of thousands of people with schizophrenia,

834
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:22,229
it's not your fault. It's a neuro genetic disorder.

835
00:49:22,449 --> 00:49:24,729
All you've done is freed them

836
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:30,360
all you've done when you figured out that this kid in your classroom where you're

837
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:35,860
a teacher just can't learn to read and this kid is just lazy and un mot

838
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:36,919
no,

839
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:40,649
there's something in their cortex that could be identified by

840
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:44,699
scientists so that they reverse letters in their mind.

841
00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:46,080
They have dyslexia,

842
00:49:46,429 --> 00:49:52,010
it's not their fault. We can't explain yet who gets dyslexia and who doesn't?

843
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:55,169
We have only hints from prenatal environment, blah, blah, blah.

844
00:49:55,229 --> 00:49:57,209
But we know enough that

845
00:49:57,570 --> 00:50:01,199
it is both intellectually and morally bankrupt

846
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:05,520
to decide that this child is lazy and unmotivated

847
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:08,580
and to instead recognize we've identified

848
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:11,610
their particular type of biological constraint

849
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:16,750
and all that's going to happen in the future is more and more and more of those.

850
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:20,300
And all we can be at this point is accepting

851
00:50:20,419 --> 00:50:25,320
that a whole lot of things that pulls out the ugliest in us

852
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:27,179
in the way of judgment.

853
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:32,750
We're gonna wind up saying, oh my God, I had no, I had no idea.

854
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,290
It had something to do with that

855
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:36,840
or framed a different way. Yeah. Yeah.

856
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:40,110
Yeah, we can't sit there and say somebody with this sort of upbringing,

857
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:44,110
we can absolutely predict that they're gonna wind up going to

858
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:47,320
a top university or wind up being a multiple murderer.

859
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:50,189
Yeah, we can't predict that yet. The science isn't good enough.

860
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,479
The science is good enough

861
00:50:52,665 --> 00:50:54,445
on a population level.

862
00:50:54,675 --> 00:50:58,334
Any time you could look at an entire population

863
00:50:58,475 --> 00:51:04,245
and say for every increased incidence of a horrible childhood experience,

864
00:51:04,554 --> 00:51:07,574
you've just increased 35% the likelihood that they're

865
00:51:07,584 --> 00:51:09,995
going to be arrested by the time they're 20

866
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:11,989
you got enough science.

867
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,840
At that point,

868
00:51:12,899 --> 00:51:17,840
you've got enough science that you better know you have no leg to stand on.

869
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:22,120
If you sit there and say this kid this 20 year old,

870
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,320
what can I say? They're just plain evil. This kid,

871
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:29,580
if you 35% for each step,

872
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,909
there's enough science at this point,

873
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,350
there's enough knowledge there.

874
00:51:34,419 --> 00:51:37,649
If you have, I don't know whatever percent predictability

875
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:41,909
that if your mother was drinking heavily when you're a fetus,

876
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:46,350
you've got this likelihood of having an IQ below this.

877
00:51:46,649 --> 00:51:49,290
And someday when you're failing classes,

878
00:51:50,669 --> 00:51:52,219
we know enough science already.

879
00:51:52,229 --> 00:51:58,719
In all these cases, we know enough science because we run an entire society on

880
00:51:58,989 --> 00:52:01,030
statistical guilt

881
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:06,830
and statistical wonderful accomplishments. And we know enough now to know that

882
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:08,449
those are not OK.

883
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:13,290
So I have one last question then

884
00:52:13,709 --> 00:52:18,110
what would it take for, for someone to convince you

885
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:23,719
that you're wrong and actually free will exists?

886
00:52:25,419 --> 00:52:28,959
OK? Here's, here's my pain in the ass response.

887
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:34,520
And the philosophers are going to like, oh come on, give me a break. Um

888
00:52:34,909 --> 00:52:37,760
The version that they start off with is oh, come on,

889
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:41,689
give me a break is you've just done something, you've pulled a trigger

890
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:42,719
on a gun,

891
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:47,899
you just did something consequential And here's the muscles that contract it.

892
00:52:47,909 --> 00:52:52,229
And here's the three motor neurons that just sent that command.

893
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:56,370
And if you wanna convince us that free will actually exist,

894
00:52:56,379 --> 00:52:58,370
show us that those neurons

895
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:01,020
just did what they did

896
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:05,659
independent of what any other neuron in the brain was doing at that moment.

897
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:06,989
If you could do that,

898
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,429
you've just proven free will. And they say, oh come on, give us a break.

899
00:53:10,439 --> 00:53:12,229
That's ridiculous. A demand.

900
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:15,100
I would demand a whole lot more than that.

901
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:16,860
I would say.

902
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:21,909
Show me that those three neurons just told you to pull that trigger,

903
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,610
having nothing to do with what any other neuron was whispering to it at the time

904
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:30,479
and having nothing to do with your hormone levels that morning

905
00:53:30,709 --> 00:53:32,800
and having nothing to do with your history of

906
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,159
trauma and having nothing to do with your genes.

907
00:53:35,169 --> 00:53:39,389
So show me that if you had changed any of those,

908
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:42,919
those neurons would still have done the exact same thing at that moment,

909
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:44,909
then I'll believe in free will

910
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,469
and you can't,

911
00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:51,739
you can't show that because nothing going on in you right now

912
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:57,219
is anything but the outcome of all of that stuff that came beforehand,

913
00:53:57,229 --> 00:54:03,389
perhaps unpredictably, perhaps in some nonlinear, non additive cool way,

914
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:09,209
perhaps in an emergent way that we can't even begin to mix. But that's all we are.

915
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:15,020
Nothing more or less and show me a neuron that just decided to do what it did

916
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:19,429
independent of everything that came before that millisecond.

917
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,080
And if you could do that, I believe in free will

918
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,370
and uh philosophers are gonna hate it.

919
00:54:26,379 --> 00:54:30,610
But what I think any biologist who knows this stuff would say is,

920
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:31,560
yeah,

921
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,570
that's kind of what you need to show.

922
00:54:35,370 --> 00:54:40,429
That's kind of the proof that is needed to show that there really is free will

923
00:54:41,129 --> 00:54:44,070
and that's pretty damn unlikely to be able to show that.

924
00:54:46,409 --> 00:54:50,330
OK. So let's see if someone accepts the challenge.

925
00:54:52,379 --> 00:54:53,550
So,

926
00:54:53,800 --> 00:55:00,040
yeah, so the book is again, determined a science of life without free will.

927
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:03,909
I'm leaving a link within the description box of this interview.

928
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:04,979
Um Doctor

929
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:08,139
Sapolsky, just before we go apart from the book,

930
00:55:08,149 --> 00:55:11,100
would you like to mention briefly where people can

931
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:13,550
find you and your work on the internet?

932
00:55:13,959 --> 00:55:14,610
Um

933
00:55:15,090 --> 00:55:17,389
Let's see, I'm I am

934
00:55:17,649 --> 00:55:20,129
a medieval peasant in that.

935
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:24,679
Not only don't, I do Facebook, I don't know how to, don't, not

936
00:55:25,429 --> 00:55:28,649
only do I not do Instagram or any of these

937
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,360
things that my kids say that I don't understand.

938
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,229
So I have no presence there, but

939
00:55:33,629 --> 00:55:38,129
there's a bunch of my lectures that have been put up on youtube.

940
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:39,209
Um

941
00:55:39,989 --> 00:55:43,760
I teach a class at Stanford every other year on

942
00:55:43,899 --> 00:55:46,330
the biology of human social behavior.

943
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:49,919
That's basically the last hour stretched out over entire semester.

944
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:50,889
And years ago,

945
00:55:50,899 --> 00:55:54,080
Stanford posted all of those lectures up there and

946
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:56,110
one of these years I have to update them.

947
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:56,489
So

948
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,209
go to youtube.

949
00:55:58,409 --> 00:56:02,179
Uh You'll see I'm doing the exact same ranting and raving

950
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:06,449
word for word and a number of those like talks that overlap,

951
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:08,689
but that would be a good place.

952
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,260
Ok, great. So, Doctor

953
00:56:12,649 --> 00:56:15,659
Sapolsky, thank you again for coming on the show.
