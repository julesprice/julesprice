Hello everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the Center.

1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,380
I'm your host as always Ricardo

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,079
Loops. And today I'm joined by

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:07,599
Dr Mia

4
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:08,029
Massimi.

5
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:11,649
She is Professor of Philosophy of Science in the

6
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:14,369
Department of Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh,

7
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,329
affiliated with the Higgs Center for Theoretical Physics.

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,194
She works in the area of history and Philosophy

9
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:24,784
of Science with the focus on the physical sciences.

10
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:28,135
And today we are focusing on her book Perspective

11
00:00:28,584 --> 00:00:33,134
of Realism, which by the way, just recently won the 2023 Lacas

12
00:00:34,055 --> 00:00:35,345
awards. So

13
00:00:35,555 --> 00:00:35,735
Dr

14
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:36,634
Massimi,

15
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:39,404
welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

16
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:41,794
Thank you so much for having me Ricardo

17
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:42,845
to be here.

18
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:48,880
OK. So to get into the book, I would like to start by asking you this.

19
00:00:48,889 --> 00:00:52,779
So what is realism in science?

20
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:56,970
And by the way, uh when, when I mean, realism is, are there

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,319
different kinds of realism or not?

22
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,939
Sure. Yeah. So um

23
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:12,089
what we call realism in philosophy of science is really um a broad um family of views

24
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:17,669
um that normally are characterized by um series of commitments

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,870
um

26
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,629
that um are distinctive of what we would like to think of a realist position.

27
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:24,839
Now,

28
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,550
uh what those commitments are obviously um

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,779
are fairly well understood, but also change

30
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,540
in a very subtle way depending on

31
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:40,540
which specific variety of realism one is willing to subscribe to.

32
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,889
Um So I would say that what defines realism are two main

33
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:47,250
commitments.

34
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:51,099
Uh One is the idea that there is uh uh uh uh

35
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:52,769
some

36
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,319
relationship between science and

37
00:01:56,589 --> 00:01:57,970
um nature

38
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,449
that is usually captured by the notion of truth.

39
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:04,970
Um And the other is that there has to be some

40
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,880
kind of representational relation between how science and scientific theory,

41
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,110
scientific models

42
00:02:11,279 --> 00:02:12,300
relate

43
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,179
to the target system.

44
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,050
So if you ask me,

45
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:18,899
I would say um realism is defined by

46
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:22,669
those two broad notions of truth and representation.

47
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,809
Now, obviously, we may disagree about what we mean by truth.

48
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,610
We may disagree slightly about what we mean by

49
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,830
representation, how models represent reality.

50
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,619
Um So, depending on how

51
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,179
different philosophers characterize those notions,

52
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,660
you may get different varieties of realism.

53
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:45,720
Um So, over really the past uh 40 50 years,

54
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:48,059
there has been a proliferation of views that

55
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:51,860
call themselves or style themselves as realist view.

56
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:57,259
Um Some of them are um redefining some of those notions of truth.

57
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,619
So you have variety of pragmatic realism or internal realism.

58
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:06,110
Um Others are rethinking the exact nature

59
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:10,270
of the relationship between science and nature um

60
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,309
uh in terms of representation.

61
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,830
So you have varieties of selective realism, for example, that

62
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,589
um endorse the presentational commitment,

63
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,039
but they would be selective about which aspects of reality

64
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:26,550
the model is committed to represent.

65
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:32,649
So very broadly, truth and representation are the two key commitments.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,600
Uh And within the broad umbrella, there is a, a

67
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,179
full spectrum of views that may slightly

68
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,149
differ in how they understand those two notions

69
00:03:43,009 --> 00:03:45,070
and how those two notions enter into

70
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,869
um our way of thinking about science and, and reality

71
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:56,660
and related to that, what would an anti realist stance in science entail?

72
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,720
So, um

73
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,289
going back to this idea that, you know,

74
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,990
truth and representations are some of the two key commitments.

75
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,199
Um

76
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,330
uh anti realist view

77
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:14,869
views and plural can be characterized by

78
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,850
uh playing down some of those um notions.

79
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:23,540
So for example, you find the varieties of instrumentalist views,

80
00:04:23,549 --> 00:04:28,089
they are anti realist views because they are not committed to the notion that

81
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,420
um

82
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,929
uh truth is any important element in the way in

83
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,149
which we think about the relation between science and reality.

84
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,450
Um

85
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,769
You get varieties of constructivism

86
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,859
um that likewise

87
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,910
uh would challenge the idea that uh representation really

88
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,440
plays an important role in how models latch onto,

89
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:53,980
onto the world on the realities.

90
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,250
Um So there's a broad spectrum of views really

91
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,380
going back to um 1980 the scientific image of Basman

92
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:01,760
Pras.

93
00:05:02,109 --> 00:05:02,410
And

94
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:07,660
um that has been a landmark book for a constructive empiricism.

95
00:05:08,029 --> 00:05:10,410
Um It's a classic example of an anterial

96
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,519
view where

97
00:05:11,709 --> 00:05:16,839
um the notion of truth is replaced by notion of empirical adequacy, for example.

98
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:18,309
So according to a

99
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:18,489
fra

100
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:18,899
and die of

101
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,899
science is not to deliver

102
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:21,820
um

103
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,940
theories, they are approximately true but to deliver theories, they are pi

104
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,059
adequate.

105
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:33,250
Um two more recently varieties of epistemological constructivism.

106
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,989
So, um Mike Boone

107
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,959
um building on the process and defense form a form of constructivism and

108
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:46,790
um how she conceptualizes the relationship between models and reality.

109
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:47,829
Um

110
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:52,890
So this is just an example, but obviously the family is much broader than that.

111
00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:57,959
And what is a scientific perspective?

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,519
Um

113
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:03,339
So it's a great question, what is STV perspective?

114
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,179
So the term um has a bit of an history.

115
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:12,089
Um The way I've been using it in my book um really has a um a predecessor.

116
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,730
The closest predecessor

117
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,829
is in

118
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,299
Ron's uh book on scientific perspective is

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,970
uh the way Ron

120
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,500
Giri originally defined the notion of a scientific perspective was really

121
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:30,619
in analogy uh with Thomas Coon's notion of a disciplinary matrix.

122
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,899
So disciplinary matrix is a um

123
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,700
a slightly more refined notion of uh probably

124
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:39,739
the more familiar notion of S and TV paradigm

125
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:41,109
um

126
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:47,480
in the sense that it indicates uh a family of um practices

127
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:51,570
and commitments that particular community has at a particular historical time.

128
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,049
The way in which

129
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,690
Rangiri originally defined the Oslo

130
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,769
scientific perspective in, in, in the book

131
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,839
was really in terms of families or models. So Rangiri

132
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,079
was building on a long standing tradition, going back to Patrick Sap

133
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,070
in the 19 sixties onwards,

134
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,559
um

135
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,609
whereby uh we need to think of scientific theories as, as families or models.

136
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,970
Uh starting with high level models,

137
00:07:17,149 --> 00:07:20,760
uh representational models, going all the way down to

138
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,459
um models of the experiment, data model and so forth.

139
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:29,329
What I do in the book is to slightly move away from

140
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,690
Maroni's definition.

141
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,220
Um Because I would like to think of a scientific

142
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,779
perspective as something broader than just the family of models.

143
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:39,769
So for me,

144
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,029
a scientific perspective is the historically and

145
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,359
culturally situated practice of particular communities,

146
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:48,010
a particular historical time.

147
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,869
And I understand really this notion of practice in a very, very broad sense um

148
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:54,980
um

149
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,760
to include varieties of knowledge that

150
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,350
um may not necessarily have well defined formalized modeling practices.

151
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,579
Um

152
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,350
So broadly speaking, a scientific perspective is a,

153
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:12,540
is a historically situated practice of a community.

154
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,160
And um here I borrow on the literature in epistemology.

155
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,660
Um there's been again, a very important literature on perspective is coming from

156
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,920
epistemology and

157
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:25,700
Aaron Sosa in particular

158
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,079
knowledge in perspective uh book

159
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,470
uh from which I'm drawing in thinking that really what

160
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,799
SN TV perspective does is not just to um advance

161
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,229
um a series of claims of knowledge,

162
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,539
but also provide the um experimental theoretical and

163
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:49,500
technological tools for reliably making those claims of knowledge

164
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:52,099
as well as providing um

165
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:59,460
methodological and epistemic principles that can justify the reliability of um

166
00:09:00,369 --> 00:09:02,760
of our uh uh uh

167
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,929
uh practices for making those claims of knowledge. So it's kind of a a

168
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:11,109
three fold distinction between the body of claims of knowledge,

169
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:15,489
the experimental theoretical conceptual tools to reliably make them

170
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,719
and the methodological epistemic principle that justify the

171
00:09:18,729 --> 00:09:21,500
reliability of those uh of those tools.

172
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:26,599
And that's the, the, the very broad way in which I've been using the term in the book.

173
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:30,320
And what about a perspective

174
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:30,489
of

175
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:37,750
realism? What does it mean exactly? And what flavor of realism applies to it?

176
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:39,599
So, um

177
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,030
yeah, that's a great question.

178
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,880
Going back to the original question about

179
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:45,719
varieties of realism and family of realism.

180
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,159
Um

181
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:48,729
I'd like to think of prospect

182
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:52,080
our realism as a view that is committed to

183
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,320
the notion of truth as correspondence and the idea that

184
00:09:56,969 --> 00:10:02,390
um our theories, our models especially uh represent reality.

185
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,429
So it's a realist view.

186
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,479
But the way I present the view in the book is that it, it's not a metaphysics first

187
00:10:10,729 --> 00:10:13,239
uh view about realism. So very often

188
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,760
what you find is that realism is defined by

189
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:23,119
uh metaphysics first approaches. So if someone declared themselves a realist,

190
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,799
what they really mean is that they are committed to

191
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:30,450
spelling out to what the metaphysical building blocks of nature are

192
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:32,710
or they are committed to

193
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:38,070
um tell a story about uh what the metaphysical foundations of reality are.

194
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,669
And the metaphysical story typically involves

195
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:41,590
um

196
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,969
different flavors of metaphysics.

197
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:49,020
So some people are committed to natural properties others are committed to

198
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:49,609
the

199
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:51,669
there are dispositions

200
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,760
um

201
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,719
or other people believe in causal powers.

202
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,890
Um

203
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:57,679
per

204
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:57,909
the

205
00:10:58,119 --> 00:10:59,590
realism is not

206
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,669
a metaphysics first approach in the sense

207
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,760
that although there is a metaphysical part,

208
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,159
uh which is the second part of the book, um the primary aim is really um

209
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,950
trying to uh

210
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:16,000
uh in a way show how that metaphysical

211
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,890
commitment is really downstream to an epistemological project.

212
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,849
So what really matters to me is to

213
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,909
trying to understand how we produce reliable knowledge

214
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:32,309
over time and how a plurality of historical and cultural situated perspectives

215
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:33,380
um

216
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,859
are able to uh deliver that reliable knowledge over time.

217
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,489
So um I see realism not so much as uh

218
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,700
um an exercise in trying to

219
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:52,580
uh unveil the metaphysical building block of nature, but I see metaphysics as the

220
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,780
downstream outcome of how we tell a story

221
00:11:56,789 --> 00:12:00,099
about how we produce reliable knowledge over time.

222
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:03,169
So there is a metaphysical part. So ultimately, spec

223
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:03,309
of

224
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,130
realism is realism about phenomena about modally robust phenomenon.

225
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:09,309
And that obviously involves

226
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,239
really finding the very notion of phenomena that has a long philosophical history.

227
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,770
And it's, it's, it's part of what they're doing in the second part of the book.

228
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,690
So if you ask me, what kind of flavor is perspective, a

229
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:24,250
realism, it's really realism about moderate robust phenomena.

230
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:25,849
Um

231
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,289
But as I said, I see that metaphysical commitment as, as the outcome of

232
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:32,380
uh um uh a

233
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,150
more important exercise, which is trying to understand how

234
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:39,890
um different communities over time and

235
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,869
culture produce reliable knowledge over time.

236
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,229
But then where is, where exactly is the perspective,

237
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:51,330
all nature in scientific representation?

238
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:53,090
So, yeah,

239
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:54,919
what that perspective is enters into the

240
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:57,359
story of how we produce reliable knowledge,

241
00:12:57,369 --> 00:12:57,669
right?

242
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:58,489
So um

243
00:12:59,109 --> 00:13:01,340
I can think of a plurality of

244
00:13:01,349 --> 00:13:04,520
communities that are historical and cultural situated,

245
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:07,809
different historical periods, different cultures and so forth.

246
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,260
Can we tell a story about

247
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,500
how that knowledge is produced a across these different communities?

248
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,429
And how is that story going to look like?

249
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:23,570
Um So one thing I definitely wanted to do in the book is to avoid any

250
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:27,010
um standard template that you find in the literature

251
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,530
on realism about realism of being some kind of convergence

252
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:36,760
to a reality that um in a way we all agree upon.

253
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:40,239
Um There is no convergence in perspective of realism.

254
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,119
Um The way I use often this metaphor in the book taken for

255
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:45,239
um

256
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,390
the, the

257
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:46,700
o

258
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,280
Borges at the Garden of Forking Path, they

259
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:50,760
are

260
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,390
uh producing knowledge is a bit like going through a

261
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,770
garden of forking path and kind of zigzagging where at each

262
00:13:57,969 --> 00:14:02,609
juncture, we have to make a choice about which path we want to go down. So there is no

263
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,440
uh or underlying picture, the realism is a convergence to

264
00:14:06,849 --> 00:14:09,280
because really it's a realism about phenomena,

265
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:13,739
there's no realism about any fundamental metaphysical reality, as I said,

266
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,320
the cause of powers, dispositional essence is that we want to call it.

267
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:18,679
Um

268
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,450
So those phenomena are encountered by different

269
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,500
communities across different periods and across different cultures

270
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:29,250
um in a reliable way or in a way that we are able to

271
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:34,700
uh uh to see how their situated practices intersect with one another.

272
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,739
So this is where the perspective that comes in, right? Because traditionally,

273
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,140
um

274
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:45,539
the very idea that the starting point of conversations about realism

275
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:46,500
um

276
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,869
is, is, is,

277
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,119
is is human beings in their plurality and historically and cultural situated, this

278
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,510
has appeared to be a stumbling block to any realist project.

279
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,239
How could one ever possibly defend realism, especially about science?

280
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:07,200
Once we take really seriously that

281
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:12,359
there is a plurality of um historically situated communities and their culture.

282
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:17,950
So that was the starting point of my um kind of journey uh for the book.

283
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,059
Um I went back to the notion of representation.

284
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,440
I said at the beginning through the representations are

285
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,390
the two key commitment of any realist view.

286
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:31,150
And I wanted to understand what makes some representations pers

287
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,590
respectable and whether there is a way of

288
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:37,820
reconciling the perspective of representation with realism.

289
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,830
Um So at the very beginning of the book,

290
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,190
I go back to the analogy between art and science

291
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,599
and that has been well explored since the time of,

292
00:15:47,609 --> 00:15:50,049
well, it's a long story, long tradition really.

293
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:51,739
Uh but more recently, Basra

294
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,859
and 2008 book on a scientific representation,

295
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:58,640
paradoxes of perspectives has been a very influential

296
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:01,799
uh book for uh for my own personal journey,

297
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,169
but also Kathrine Elgin uh 2017 book.

298
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:07,609
Uh True Enough,

299
00:16:07,619 --> 00:16:09,619
uh is also very important for

300
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,780
discussing the perspective nature of representation.

301
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:16,150
And so really thinking about the analogy between art and science,

302
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,299
what makes some representation perspect?

303
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,020
Traditionally, we tend to think of that uh

304
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,770
question in terms of

305
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,599
the representation is

306
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:29,200
situated is from a particular vantage point.

307
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:33,770
So um a drawing, a perspective drawing is what makes the drawing perspective

308
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,750
is that the scene is painted

309
00:16:35,989 --> 00:16:37,869
from a particular angle.

310
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:39,929
And obviously,

311
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:43,979
the angle means that there are other aspects of the scene

312
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:46,960
that we can't really see uh from that particular angle.

313
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:48,469
So there is an element of lusion

314
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,640
and there is what Vansen

315
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,849
called

316
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:54,369
um a horizon of alternatives.

317
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,809
We could have chosen to represent the scene

318
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,570
from different angles and we could have chosen to

319
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,010
represent the object with different attributes.

320
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:04,689
Um

321
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:09,229
So the story I turn in chapter two and three of the book,

322
00:17:09,239 --> 00:17:12,188
which is really the beginning of the of the book is

323
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:17,009
that very often that specific way of thinking about perspective of representation

324
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,709
um has been um

325
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,239
regarded as a as a, as a difficulty for any realism or a realist project.

326
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:28,489
Um

327
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:33,058
Precisely because if the representation is situated is from a particular angle,

328
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:36,058
how can we ever be in a position of saying what the

329
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:41,458
real nature of the object is, our knowledge is always partially occluded and,

330
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:43,418
and, and, and not complete.

331
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,060
Um So the story I tell is that, well, actually, if you look at the

332
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,560
nature of perspective and drawing in art,

333
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,260
um there are two ways of thinking about perspective,

334
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,660
um a representation is perspective,

335
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,439
not only because it's drawn from a particular angle, but because it's also

336
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:03,280
drawn towards one or more vantage point.

337
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,550
Actually, technically, this is the definition of a

338
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,640
perspect

339
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,760
uh representation that

340
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,520
um there is one or more

341
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:14,050
vantage point towards which lines converge.

342
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:17,030
And that's what creates the optical illusion that you can see a

343
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,880
three dimensional space on what effectively is a two dimensional canvas.

344
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:22,280
Um

345
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:26,280
And, and so I play with that metaphor in art to say, well, really,

346
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,020
those are two aspects of the same coin really, you know,

347
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,880
you the representation is perspect

348
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,630
as drawn from a particular vantage point only

349
00:18:33,869 --> 00:18:38,530
in so far as there is one or more vantage points that allows us to create this,

350
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,849
this these windows of reality,

351
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:45,869
uh this, this three dimensional space emerging out of a two dimensional canvas.

352
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:49,459
And so that's my entry point for the idea that there is a way of

353
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:51,760
telling a story about realism

354
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:54,959
starting with the situated nature of the representation.

355
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,079
So tell us now about the notion of pluralism.

356
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,069
Where is it and how does it apply to science?

357
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:09,199
Yeah. So pluralism is really uh again, a big family

358
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,329
of views.

359
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:16,050
Uh I'm drawing really here on a long standing tradition that has emphasized

360
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:19,239
the importance of pluralism in science.

361
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:23,569
Um explanatory pluralism and methodological pluralism

362
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,609
uh tradition. Going back to Ellen Longino

363
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,530
and

364
00:19:27,969 --> 00:19:32,930
uh Carol, a fair and Miriam Solomon and Sandra Mitchell, integrity, pluralism.

365
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,680
Obviously, John Dupre promiscuous

366
00:19:34,949 --> 00:19:37,849
realism and many, many, many others.

367
00:19:38,329 --> 00:19:40,420
Um the kind of pluralism

368
00:19:40,589 --> 00:19:41,290
um

369
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:46,479
that matters to my story is again, perspect about pluralism is pluralism of

370
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:48,890
perspectives as I have defined it.

371
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:51,839
Uh So my emphasis is not so much

372
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:56,010
on um explanatory methodological or ontological pluralism.

373
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,550
It's really pluralism about

374
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:00,369
uh uh historically, cult

375
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:06,170
is the practices. It's, it's a fact that science is the outcome of this plurality of

376
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:11,400
perspectives and communities that have endorsed different practices.

377
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,719
Um

378
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:15,969
And then obviously, then the question becomes OK.

379
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:20,599
Um As I was just saying with the problem of perspective or representation is pers

380
00:20:21,229 --> 00:20:24,229
sorry, representation from a point of view, representation

381
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,880
uh uh towards one or more vantage point,

382
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:33,170
the question is OK, if you take the pluralism as a fact about science,

383
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:36,819
what kind of uh realism

384
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,359
emerges out of that, can we even talk about realism

385
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,500
or should we just say that we are

386
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:44,640
um

387
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:49,969
confined to a plurality of um ways of knowing

388
00:20:49,979 --> 00:20:53,290
they are distinctive of different communities and their practices?

389
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:54,599
Um

390
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,319
But we can't really attempt to tell a story about

391
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:01,180
science and scientific knowledge and,

392
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:03,079
and realism about science

393
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,040
and the best that we can do is this plurality of scientific practices.

394
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:09,060
So, what I do in the book is to say, no, no, no.

395
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:15,770
We, we can take the pluralism, perspect of pluralism as a starting point.

396
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,050
It's a fact about science. The science is produced in that way.

397
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,130
But that doesn't mean that we need to end up

398
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,790
with some kind of instrumentalist or anti realist view.

399
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,020
There's still a way of defending realism in science.

400
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:30,689
Um

401
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,739
starting with perspect about pluralism.

402
00:21:34,489 --> 00:21:35,000
Mhm

403
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,750
And so another thing that you tackle in

404
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,229
your book is the problem of inconsistent model.

405
00:21:42,239 --> 00:21:48,109
So what is that problem really about and can perspective is help us tackle it?

406
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,119
Yeah. So kind of zooming into uh this problem of how to reconcile

407
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:59,530
um Perspect about pluralism as pluralism of perspectives and, and realism.

408
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:02,520
The problem in consistent models uh is,

409
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:07,650
is, is one of, is one of the major problem for any perspective is

410
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:08,510
um

411
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,439
because this is where we the pluralism um

412
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,170
appears to be somehow at odds with any realist claim.

413
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:24,390
Um So it's a problem that was really brought to the general attention um

414
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,130
maybe 13 years ago uh roughly

415
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:33,109
uh by uh Mary Morrison um in a, in a beautiful paper where

416
00:22:33,349 --> 00:22:37,829
she discusses the plurality of models in some areas of science. So she says,

417
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,229
well, look at nuclear physics, right?

418
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:43,349
Um So the areas of science where there is one model,

419
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,300
we all agree more or less that uh you know, it is the

420
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,300
um best model to describe some kind of phenomena.

421
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:52,819
But there are other areas where there seems to be a pluralism,

422
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:57,050
a kind of endemic pluralism and as, as pluralism of models.

423
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:59,180
So the example of Morrison is that

424
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,280
if you look at nuclear physics,

425
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,560
and if you ask the question about what is the atomic nucleus,

426
00:23:05,369 --> 00:23:06,270
um

427
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,170
you find different answers to the question depending

428
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,579
on whether we are studying a nuclear fission.

429
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:16,310
In which case, we represent the nucleus as if it was a liquid

430
00:23:16,609 --> 00:23:18,770
of incompressible nuclear fluid.

431
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:23,229
Uh But if we are studying um stellar nucleus synthesis,

432
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:25,290
we use different families of models,

433
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,359
the cluster model whereby the atomic nucleus is represented as a

434
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:30,260
tetrahedron

435
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,780
with a particular structures of problems and neutrons.

436
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:38,630
And obviously, if we're studying other phenomena in high energy physics,

437
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,290
we use yet another class of models.

438
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,699
We use the quark models to describe what happens when we smash protons to say at LHC.

439
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:51,449
So Morrison Point was, well, if we have this pluralism of models,

440
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,479
does it even make sense to ask

441
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,800
what is the atomic nucleus? I mean, w where is the realism there? Right? I mean,

442
00:23:58,969 --> 00:24:01,489
we have different stories about what the nucleus is.

443
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,449
Um is there one which is the best one? And if, if there is, then what about the others?

444
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:10,540
Isn't it better to adopt some kind of instrumental is

445
00:24:11,979 --> 00:24:12,760
um

446
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,420
perspective is,

447
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:21,239
has often been accused of being a form of instrumental is so um Morrison

448
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:25,079
uh argument in that paper that has also been

449
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,959
rested by other philosophers like

450
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:28,280
an

451
00:24:28,459 --> 00:24:28,560
Chakravorti,

452
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,280
for example, in

453
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:31,650
um in, in, in, in,

454
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,180
in his book on um the the kind of

455
00:24:35,189 --> 00:24:38,660
metaphysics of nature is that very often perspective is,

456
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:42,449
doesn't live up to the promise of realism because it looks like

457
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:46,219
uh what we really mean by perspective is is the

458
00:24:46,229 --> 00:24:50,000
representation is drawn from a particular point of view.

459
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:55,329
So if you look at the nucleus from the point of view of um fission, then it looks like a

460
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,229
liquid drop. But if you look at the nucleus from the point of view of stellar

461
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,150
nucleus synthesis, then it looks like a tetrad.

462
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:07,060
And I think it's that way of thinking about perspective is that has really um

463
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,890
meant that perspective is for a long time as has

464
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,310
been regarded as kind of no much for realism.

465
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,540
Um So I tackled the problem of inconsistent models in chapter three of the book.

466
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,180
And um

467
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,719
I show that the problem is not really a problem for perspective

468
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:28,410
is in so far as we are clear about um some

469
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:32,250
hidden assumptions that seems to be creeping into the argument.

470
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,920
And so some of those

471
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,130
assumptions are

472
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:37,489
uh in my view are, are really um

473
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:41,489
kind of very demanding and unduly stringent

474
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,410
realist assumption that

475
00:25:43,589 --> 00:25:48,069
seems to assume that models represent by mapping 1 to 1

476
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,979
aspects of the model with aspects of the target system.

477
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:53,930
And that seems to understand the notion

478
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:56,650
of truth going back to representation of truth

479
00:25:57,209 --> 00:25:59,579
in terms of uh truth maker.

480
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:02,050
So there has to be a ontological state of

481
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,849
affairs in terms of ascription of essential properties to particular

482
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,930
that make some claims of knowledge true.

483
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:11,969
And now if one endorses that view about truth,

484
00:26:11,979 --> 00:26:15,060
the truth makers and representation as mapping,

485
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:21,160
I think Morrison has a point that this plurality of model seems to be a problem for,

486
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,099
for realism,

487
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:23,790
we can't think of the nucleus as

488
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,770
having inconsistent or incompatible essential properties.

489
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:28,780
Um

490
00:26:29,349 --> 00:26:32,380
But what I do in chapter three of the book is to resist

491
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:34,579
that assumption and saying,

492
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:35,150
uh why,

493
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,900
why do we need to buy into representation as mapping or

494
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,800
what do we need to buy into truth as truth maker?

495
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,949
Maybe there is a different way of thinking about

496
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:48,000
what models do and how they represent from a perspective

497
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:52,270
or point of view that doesn't necessarily land us into this

498
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:53,760
um uh quo

499
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:59,060
of inconsistent essential properties ascribed to the same target system.

500
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,219
And so it's a very important problem because it's really um

501
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:08,239
the starting point of a way of reconciling realism or perspective is

502
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,869
and uh related to perspective

503
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,959
modeling and perspective of models. Um

504
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:23,300
What do you mean by them being blueprints on reality as you say in the book?

505
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,219
And uh perhaps related to these,

506
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:32,339
how do the concepts of conceivability and possibility enter into it.

507
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:34,339
Yeah. So

508
00:27:36,199 --> 00:27:41,280
um what I do from chapter four or five onwards is to spell out the positive story,

509
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:41,619
right?

510
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,319
And not just to say,

511
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,969
we need to resist all this assumption and duly stringent assumption. So

512
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,329
um a different way of thinking about what models do

513
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:52,819
is to tell a different story about how to represent

514
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:57,560
their target system without ascribing essential properties to the target system.

515
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,829
So in that context that develop the

516
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,050
view that models really are inferential blueprints,

517
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,719
so they are blueprints that allows different communities.

518
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:08,760
And again, think of a plurality

519
00:28:08,989 --> 00:28:13,800
of historical and cultural situated communities to draw inferences

520
00:28:14,229 --> 00:28:20,079
about relevant model, robust phenomena from a plurality of data set.

521
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,599
So what the model does is not so much

522
00:28:23,939 --> 00:28:29,319
mapping 1 to 1 aspects of the model and aspects of reality. I think we have been

523
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:33,569
very often in philosophy, science, we have this picture that models represent.

524
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:34,310
But as if

525
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,390
really the primary function of the model was to

526
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,459
mirror a map onto the target system, right?

527
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,739
But that idea seems very counterintuitive to me even I mean,

528
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,380
think of well established model like the DN model of the nucleus, right.

529
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,069
I mean, we don't,

530
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:54,709
we don't use the model because we want to necessarily represent the nucleus,

531
00:28:54,719 --> 00:28:58,689
we use the model because we want to make inferences right about the

532
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,380
that we want to study, we want to understand how DNA behaves,

533
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,930
we want to understand how

534
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:09,109
uh possible error in the um in the in the process of DNA

535
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:10,520
uh

536
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:10,839
uh

537
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,420
chain of events may happen.

538
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,130
So we,

539
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,130
we want to ask those questions about what is possible

540
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,459
about DNA replication and mistakes in the DNA replication.

541
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:28,500
So think of models really as catering to this needs of allowing us to make

542
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:33,670
uh uh relevant and appropriate inferences about phenomena that we want to study.

543
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,859
So that's what the metaphor of inferential blueprint is.

544
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,619
So models yes, do represent and do represent from a specific vantage point.

545
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:44,699
That's why we have a plurality of models used by different communities.

546
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:49,380
The primary function is not to ascribe essential properties to the target system.

547
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,699
As the metaphysicians would like us to think of

548
00:29:51,969 --> 00:29:56,500
the primary function is to allow communities to make reliable, robust,

549
00:29:57,099 --> 00:30:01,060
relevant and appropriate inferences about those uh uh those phenomena that, that,

550
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:02,400
that we want to study.

551
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,660
And so again, I use the analogy very often as I do in the book between um

552
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,030
uh uh uh perspective

553
00:30:10,199 --> 00:30:12,329
of representation in this case in architecture.

554
00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:15,040
So the idea of the inferential blueprints is borrowed from,

555
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:19,189
from architecture because again, in, in, in, in architecture, you can have uh

556
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,150
um a plurality of perspective

557
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,119
or representation of say a house that allows different communities of the

558
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:30,520
carpenter and the masons and the architects to work together and

559
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:36,790
make inferences about how the house should be built. How tall should the roof be?

560
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,979
What's the relationship between the height of the

561
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:41,000
door and the height of the roof.

562
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,640
Uh And so I use an analogy to say likewise,

563
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:47,239
whenever we want to study specific phenomenon,

564
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,859
that plurality of models allows these different communities to make those

565
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:54,900
uh uh relevant and appropriate inferences about the

566
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,219
objects so that we want to study.

567
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:02,760
Um So they find in models as really catering to um

568
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:05,479
the need of delivering knowledge about what

569
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,250
is possible about the object under study.

570
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,339
So, perspect

571
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:14,050
modeling is modeling possibilities, modeling, how things could be.

572
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,439
Um

573
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,260
And it's,

574
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,319
it's a way of answering those questions in

575
00:31:18,329 --> 00:31:20,979
a kind of very exploratory way where we have

576
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:24,180
not just one community that can reclaim full

577
00:31:24,189 --> 00:31:26,839
ownership of the knowledge of the target system,

578
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:29,750
but we need a plurality of communities

579
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,849
that I illustrate with various case studies in the book.

580
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:35,410
So I have one chapter on climate change.

581
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,180
So climate modeling in the context of studying um

582
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,500
uh global warming, one chapter on

583
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,020
developmental psychology

584
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:48,660
and one chapter on the nuclear physics where I show how in each case

585
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,140
to study specific phenomena like the stability

586
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,650
of some nuclear or difficulties with reading

587
00:31:53,969 --> 00:31:54,589
or

588
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,760
global warming.

589
00:31:56,939 --> 00:31:59,199
We need a plurality of community.

590
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:02,579
So if you want to study climate change and global warming,

591
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:10,520
you need a plurality of people that model um increase in ocean heat temperature

592
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,050
uh communities that model how glacier and permafrost

593
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:18,290
are changing under the effect of greenhouse gasses.

594
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,939
Communities that study corals and uh uh

595
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:22,750
tree rings. So then

596
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:23,520
thema

597
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,560
again to make inferences from those data to the phenomena under study.

598
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:32,229
And so it's through that plurality of modeling practices and,

599
00:32:32,239 --> 00:32:34,479
and communities that we come to know

600
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,880
very complex and multifactorial phenomena like

601
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,770
um

602
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,089
global warming, for example.

603
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,479
So that that's how I use the analogy with

604
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:46,589
models as inferential blueprint to explain our models.

605
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,020
Yes, represent, yes, represent from a perspect

606
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,050
point of view.

607
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,760
But they do so by effectively delivering knowledge about what

608
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,930
is possible concerning the object that we want to study.

609
00:32:57,969 --> 00:33:02,089
So earlier in our conversation, you alluded to this.

610
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:09,750
Uh But what are they, what are phenomena and what is the relationship between them

611
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:14,189
through this framework of perspective of realism?

612
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:18,709
Yeah. So um going back to uh

613
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,880
exactly the question of what flavor of realism is basically our realism,

614
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,910
as I mentioned in the beginning, it's really a realism about phenomena.

615
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:32,030
But I, one of the main task of the book was to redefine what I mean by phenomenon.

616
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,540
This phenomena come from a

617
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,680
long standing empi

618
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:38,910
traditions that really stretches back to,

619
00:33:39,949 --> 00:33:42,369
you know, pm 19 05, a

620
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:45,760
wonderful book on to save the phenomenon more recently, wasn't to

621
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:45,979
Pras

622
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,920
and I mentioned already in 1980 scientific image.

623
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,280
Um that also defends the view that um you know,

624
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:56,569
the reality is reality made of phenomena observable phenomena according to Tora.

625
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:58,589
Um

626
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,949
So it's very difficult to say that I'm a realist

627
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:05,719
about phenomena when the very term phenomenon has been associated

628
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:08,708
with uh a long standing and pis

629
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,199
tradition that is normally regarded phenomena is

630
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:16,030
not the sort of objects that one would have real

631
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,350
and commitment to.

632
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:18,820
Um

633
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:22,879
So what I do in the second part of the book is trying to um

634
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:25,159
articulate the positive story

635
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,250
and the positive story is that

636
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:28,958
um given this perspect

637
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,168
of pluralism,

638
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:35,949
uh where models are embedded as part of the practices of different communities,

639
00:34:36,478 --> 00:34:40,899
the inferences that we make are inferences to what I call

640
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:44,560
moly robust phenomena. So what are moly robust phenomena?

641
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,030
They're not the phenomena of the

642
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:46,300
fro

643
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:47,649
and they're not the phenomenal of Pierre

644
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,810
do m they're not the phenomena of

645
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:50,219
the Empire

646
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,100
tradition as

647
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:57,110
um faint copies or faint images of a

648
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,760
reality

649
00:34:58,959 --> 00:35:03,820
uh that lies underneath the phenomenon that we need to discover uh you know,

650
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:06,199
appealing to the metaphysician tools or

651
00:35:06,209 --> 00:35:09,659
whatever dispositional essences or because of powers

652
00:35:10,379 --> 00:35:13,770
uh phenomena of what there is in a way I'm

653
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,979
um borrowing from the country and tradition,

654
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,270
the idea that knowledge is knowledge of phenomena, but those phenomena not

655
00:35:20,379 --> 00:35:21,629
in pieces, phenomena more

656
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,580
robust.

657
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,270
And what I really mean by more of robustness

658
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:26,530
is that

659
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,669
phenomena stable event.

660
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:34,699
So there's a kind of 22 tier ontology that I articulate in chapter six of the book.

661
00:35:34,709 --> 00:35:38,159
So phenomena are stable event index to a particular domain

662
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:42,659
and they are modally robust across a plurality of

663
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,820
data to phenomena inferences.

664
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:48,489
So there are stable events in that, that there is a

665
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,879
level of reality that are called stable event where

666
00:35:51,889 --> 00:35:56,580
stability is really synonymous with low likeness for me.

667
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,040
So

668
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:01,909
um stable events are events that are such not because they are core ones,

669
00:36:01,919 --> 00:36:05,000
but because there are low like dependencies in

670
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:09,320
in the fabric of those events. So that explain why they are stable.

671
00:36:10,439 --> 00:36:15,370
But the phenomenon is not just a stable event. Uh The phenomenon

672
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,750
is the outcome of an inference made by

673
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,580
communities from data understood broadly as empirical occurrences.

674
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:27,639
So to give an example that I um given the book,

675
00:36:27,929 --> 00:36:28,500
um

676
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:35,219
it is a stable event that an electric charge is gonna be affected by

677
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:37,510
an electric or magnetic field.

678
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:41,629
So there are low like dependencies that explains how an electric

679
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:45,000
charge is going to be deflected by an external field,

680
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,669
that's a stable event in nature.

681
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:48,379
But

682
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:50,550
what we called um cathode

683
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,080
ray

684
00:36:51,189 --> 00:36:53,800
or the phenomenon of the bending of cathode

685
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:58,580
rays is the model robust phenomenon that uh was discovered by

686
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,949
JJ Thompson at the end of the 19th century using a a

687
00:37:03,129 --> 00:37:04,340
particular

688
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,250
tool that was a cato

689
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,090
tube working in a particular historically

690
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:09,560
cap

691
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,899
situated context. There was the Victorian Cambridge of the end of the century.

692
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:15,020
Um

693
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,929
And, and so

694
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:21,389
the phenomenon is not a robust because we can infer and

695
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:22,379
Reiner

696
00:37:23,149 --> 00:37:23,629
um

697
00:37:24,469 --> 00:37:27,860
the same phenomenon from different kind of data

698
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:31,969
sets by slightly tweaking the experimental conditions.

699
00:37:32,229 --> 00:37:33,550
Uh And and so forth.

700
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,760
So the model of robustness is some kind

701
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,120
of secondary property that is really a property

702
00:37:38,129 --> 00:37:41,340
of how different communities are able to robustly

703
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:44,270
infer the same phenomenon from a variety of,

704
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,290
of data.

705
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:50,449
So that's broadly speaking, the kind of phenomena for so

706
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:53,409
that I I defend in, in the book

707
00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:02,620
and with that in mind, what are natural kinds and how do we go from phenomena to kinds?

708
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:05,629
So yeah, Um

709
00:38:07,879 --> 00:38:08,080
so,

710
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,419
one of the problem I had when I was writing the book

711
00:38:10,429 --> 00:38:14,560
is that I was obviously committed to defending this phenomenon for so,

712
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,439
but I was also

713
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:20,760
very much aware that when it comes to realism,

714
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:24,540
um it's not enough to say that we live in a world where there are moli

715
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,149
robust phenomena, the bending of the cat

716
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:27,879
race,

717
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,000
the decay of the Higgs boson,

718
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,100
the growth of the

719
00:38:31,879 --> 00:38:34,780
mycelium echolocation in Beluga. Those are examples of what I call moli

720
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:38,179
robust phenomena, the pollination of flowers and so forth that

721
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:42,919
require inferences on behalf of communities to stable events in nature.

722
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,060
A realist wants uh something more than phenomena.

723
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:53,800
A realist want something about natural kinds. So a realist would say,

724
00:38:54,169 --> 00:38:54,879
um

725
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,550
I don't just want to know what the bending of cadore

726
00:38:57,979 --> 00:39:00,919
is. I want to know what the electron is. I want to know what the nucleus is.

727
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:02,820
I want to know what genes are.

728
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:07,790
I want to know, you know um what lemon and zebras and supernovas. Are

729
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,959
so those are natural kinds.

730
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:11,810
So those are

731
00:39:12,439 --> 00:39:14,320
uh kinds of things.

732
00:39:14,629 --> 00:39:19,570
And um again, realism very often has been associated with um

733
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:23,419
number of views about what national kinds are. Um

734
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:25,669
ranging from hacking. And no,

735
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:30,110
to I mentioned already, John Dupre promiscuous realism to

736
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:35,179
varieties of uh uh um microstructure and essentialism back to Hillary

737
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,560
Patnam in the 19 seventies and so forth.

738
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:42,879
Um So the story I tell in the book about natural kinds, which really a long one,

739
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:45,949
it stands from chapter seven to chapter 10 in the book

740
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:50,030
is that natural kinds are open ended

741
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,179
grouping of historically identified phenomena.

742
00:39:53,409 --> 00:39:55,899
There is nothing more, nothing over

743
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:01,060
uh natural kinds than open ended grouping of historical identified phenomena.

744
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,810
And obviously, the big challenge is OK, is this just a form of conventional, is

745
00:40:06,429 --> 00:40:10,360
a natural kind, just the label that we attach to grouping of phenomena.

746
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,830
So I had to go into um quite a lot

747
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,090
of details to clarify why the view is not a conventional

748
00:40:17,209 --> 00:40:19,560
view. And it's not an essentialist view either.

749
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,739
Um But it's really a view that tries to

750
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,439
again bring in the inferential is so phenomena,

751
00:40:26,449 --> 00:40:32,080
the outcome of inferences likewise natural kinds are the outcome of inferences.

752
00:40:32,489 --> 00:40:33,060
Um Rob

753
00:40:33,219 --> 00:40:35,800
robust, reliable, still revis

754
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,439
still open ended,

755
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:42,469
still very valuable inferences made by plurality of communities over time.

756
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,459
Um And so I'll give a full definition,

757
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:49,659
I give a full inferential story uh about national kind.

758
00:40:50,419 --> 00:40:52,840
They are called natural kinds with the human face.

759
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,979
Borrowing from Hillary but

760
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,959
1990 book realism with a human face.

761
00:40:58,449 --> 00:41:01,030
Um What I explain how those law

762
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:06,600
like dependencies in the fabric of the stable events provide effectively the

763
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:07,679
um

764
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:13,909
I I if you like the the kind of pointers in this walking in the garden of working path

765
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:17,600
in whereby communities can make

766
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,560
uh choices about

767
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,350
what to cluster or what not to cluster into the natural kind.

768
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:27,120
But to do so reliably, they need to rely on

769
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:27,550
low

770
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:30,659
like dependencies. They are part of the stable events in nature.

771
00:41:30,669 --> 00:41:33,479
So the clustering is not arbitrary, it is not conventional.

772
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,820
And so there is an element of contingencies,

773
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,040
but it's not a rampant kind of contingentism.

774
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:41,760
It's, it's kind of constrained and guided by

775
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:42,969
um low

776
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,679
like dependencies in nature.

777
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:46,699
So it's a long story

778
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,639
from chapter seven to chapter 10. And I give a

779
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,020
full detail of that in, in, in,

780
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,439
in chapter 10 of the book where I delve

781
00:41:54,449 --> 00:41:56,969
into the historical case studies about the electron.

782
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:57,909
And

783
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:58,860
yeah, sorry.

784
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:00,959
No, no, no worries.

785
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:05,419
Uh And another thing I would like to ask you is at a certain point in the book,

786
00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:08,179
you talk about contingentism.

787
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,939
So what is contingentism and how is it involved in perspective of

788
00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:15,060
realism?

789
00:42:15,879 --> 00:42:16,389
So continent

790
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,810
is, is associated precisely with

791
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:19,620
um

792
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:25,550
with this point I was making about how the um open ended grouping of phenomena

793
00:42:25,949 --> 00:42:26,629
um

794
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:30,500
is to some extent contingent in the sense that we

795
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:35,350
could have cluster different phenomena under the National Kind Electron,

796
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,260
for example,

797
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,929
um now continent,

798
00:42:37,939 --> 00:42:41,989
this historically has been a very powerful uh argument

799
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,030
coming from the history of science against a very strong

800
00:42:46,439 --> 00:42:48,489
um the physical form of realism.

801
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:49,939
Um

802
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,560
um So,

803
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:55,399
I don't know lots of people that contributed to this debate from has

804
00:42:55,699 --> 00:42:56,209
Chang to cons

805
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:56,949
for them.

806
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,659
Also Joseph Laporte.

807
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,239
Um so things could have gone otherwise, right?

808
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,550
So Joseph Laporte, in his book on Natural Con and con

809
00:43:05,689 --> 00:43:08,570
change, tell us it is a beautiful story of how,

810
00:43:08,979 --> 00:43:12,340
you know, we made a choice at some point to include the dirty

811
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:14,000
oxide into

812
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,060
um the natural kind water.

813
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,929
But there was a choice in a way that we made, we could have,

814
00:43:19,939 --> 00:43:21,090
we could have gone otherwise.

815
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:23,050
So that's the element of contingentism.

816
00:43:23,850 --> 00:43:28,350
Uh I define a particular brand of contingentism in the sense that um

817
00:43:29,379 --> 00:43:34,659
um um I'm not that kind of full blown contingent is in the sense that

818
00:43:34,669 --> 00:43:39,649
I don't think that things could have gone entirely in a completely different way.

819
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:44,250
Uh Precisely because um the way I think a phenomena

820
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:49,000
as a stable event where stability is synonymous with low likeness

821
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:55,280
means that the inferences that communities make about what phenomena goes with.

822
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,719
What other phenomena

823
00:43:57,209 --> 00:43:59,110
are not fully at our

824
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,290
discretion,

825
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,610
are not fully at our women in a way we need

826
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,179
to respond to the Tribunal of Nature as a speaker,

827
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:06,600
I find.

828
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,290
So um There are a lot like dependencies

829
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,739
that really guides those inferences that we make.

830
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,260
Um So, uh

831
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:19,300
uh and uh and so I tell a story about how um

832
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,459
every natural kind is a kind in the making.

833
00:44:23,949 --> 00:44:29,209
Uh some of those in the making kind become empty at some point when we discovered that

834
00:44:29,659 --> 00:44:32,340
maybe there's some violation of fundamental laws.

835
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:35,840
Uh So we believed in caloric, for example, back in the 19th century,

836
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:40,000
people believed that there was a substance called caloric that was responsible for

837
00:44:40,129 --> 00:44:44,879
transitional state from ice to say water to, to steam.

838
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,250
Um But some of the uh inferences that people made

839
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:52,919
about what are the phenomena that are captured by the Nashua

840
00:44:53,209 --> 00:44:53,629
Khan Caloric

841
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:59,310
uh were clearly inferences that very soon revealed their limits.

842
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,070
So um reveal their limits because

843
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:05,889
very often they were appealing to um features

844
00:45:05,899 --> 00:45:09,000
of the phenomena that were simply false.

845
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,570
So, Sadiq

846
00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:11,010
Karno was one of the

847
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:12,520
um

848
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,090
key people in the

849
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:15,889
uh formulation of the KO

850
00:45:16,229 --> 00:45:17,300
principles and the car

851
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:18,530
cycle. So Ko

852
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,139
believed in caloric

853
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,500
back in the first half of the 19th century.

854
00:45:23,899 --> 00:45:25,919
And he believed that there was a substance that

855
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:30,770
was uh uh physically conserved whenever a hot reservoir

856
00:45:30,889 --> 00:45:36,179
goes into cold reservoir. And then a new cycle starts behind like a steam engine.

857
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,739
Uh but obviously, there is no conserve calor

858
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:42,060
and there is no conservation of caloric and there

859
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,320
is no perpetual motion machine and in fact,

860
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:46,639
can be created using that principle.

861
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:50,600
So this is where we face the tribunal of experience where we can't say

862
00:45:50,919 --> 00:45:52,689
we could have had

863
00:45:52,879 --> 00:45:55,669
now in 2023 an Act

864
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,020
kind caloric

865
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,959
still alive.

866
00:45:58,969 --> 00:46:01,020
And well, no, we couldn't have had that right,

867
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:05,469
because we soon stumbled into some problems about

868
00:46:05,489 --> 00:46:08,250
some of those very phenomena that were identified,

869
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,584
identified as the phenomenon where caloric was,

870
00:46:10,814 --> 00:46:11,854
was at work.

871
00:46:12,014 --> 00:46:13,534
And uh and the fact that there was no

872
00:46:13,544 --> 00:46:16,195
conservation of caloric and if anything there was dissipation,

873
00:46:16,205 --> 00:46:19,014
which was then captured by the concept of entropy and so forth

874
00:46:19,155 --> 00:46:21,324
revealed the limits of those associations.

875
00:46:21,334 --> 00:46:25,594
So, so kind of long winded answer to your question, the contingentism means

876
00:46:26,844 --> 00:46:29,895
that although things could have gone otherwise in how communities

877
00:46:29,905 --> 00:46:33,695
came to make inferences about phenomenon connection between phenomena,

878
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:36,774
things could not have gone entirely

879
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:41,810
in a completely different ways because in a way, there are those constraints

880
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,000
concerning low

881
00:46:43,129 --> 00:46:45,399
like dependencies of the phenomena that

882
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:52,659
uh really act as pointers in the garden of working path about which inferences

883
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,250
we decide to

884
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:58,770
go down to and which inferences we decide to abandon at some point.

885
00:46:59,689 --> 00:47:00,560
-- I
-- understand.

886
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:04,090
So getting into the last part of our interview,

887
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:08,350
could you tell us now about multiculturalism and cosmo

888
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:11,040
cosmopolitanism? Science? I mean,

889
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:16,120
uh is science a multicultural and cosmopolitan enterprise?

890
00:47:16,129 --> 00:47:21,219
And what role do these two things? Multiculturalism and cosmopolitan,

891
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:24,120
cosmopolitanism play in science?

892
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:29,229
Yeah. No, thank you. So this is the final chapter of the book and it's um

893
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:30,600
um

894
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:34,610
I wanted to write that chapter because um

895
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:34,780
I,

896
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:36,159
I thought the book was going to be

897
00:47:36,169 --> 00:47:40,209
complete without a final discussion about what really

898
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:43,479
um questions about realism and perspective

899
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:44,070
iss

900
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:44,620
uh

901
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,389
are doing in, in this context.

902
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,879
Um So very often in the debate on realism,

903
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,540
philosophers have appealed to the aims of science.

904
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:57,449
So it seems that, you know, we care about discussion about realism and the

905
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,419
realism and

906
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,379
truth and representation because

907
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:02,370
we want to

908
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,739
fundamentally um

909
00:48:04,989 --> 00:48:06,739
answer questions about

910
00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:10,169
what is the goal of science and what is the aim?

911
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,659
Um

912
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:14,899
And I thought that

913
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:17,800
perspective of realism was not really

914
00:48:18,149 --> 00:48:21,939
answering that question about what the aim of goal of science is.

915
00:48:22,729 --> 00:48:26,340
Uh what perspective of realism does is to um

916
00:48:26,709 --> 00:48:29,659
offer a different lens for thinking about

917
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:35,820
realism in science, starting with this plurality of situated communities.

918
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:40,060
And once you take that step,

919
00:48:40,649 --> 00:48:44,050
the next step is to think of questions about

920
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:49,159
duties and obligations in science and rights in science. So no questions,

921
00:48:49,379 --> 00:48:51,350
aims and goals. But actually

922
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:55,840
what is science for who produces science?

923
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,629
Who has to benefit from science, who can reclaim as their own

924
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:04,149
a right to benefit from scientific knowledge.

925
00:49:04,439 --> 00:49:04,719
So the

926
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:09,110
first chapter in a way, try to answer those, those questions which are kind of more

927
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:10,070
um

928
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:14,739
ethical political questions about duties and obligations in science. So,

929
00:49:15,139 --> 00:49:20,310
multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism are again huge terms with a very long

930
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,600
and often difficult and vexed history that I wanted to use to

931
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,580
um exactly explain

932
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:29,669
they, they called the

933
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:30,100
natural

934
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:31,610
perspective of realism.

935
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:32,070
Though it's,

936
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:35,870
there's a perspective of pluralism that like there's multiculturalism,

937
00:49:35,879 --> 00:49:37,310
there's this plurality of

938
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:41,080
historically situated communities that over

939
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:43,860
time produce reliable knowledge about more

940
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,199
robust phenomena.

941
00:49:47,409 --> 00:49:50,260
But also an invitation of not thinking about

942
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:54,010
that situated nature of knowledge as some kind of

943
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,530
silo where knowledge is produced by community

944
00:49:57,989 --> 00:50:00,620
in isolation from other communities. Or

945
00:50:00,909 --> 00:50:04,600
you know, this is the um kind of picture that we had again from, you know,

946
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:05,600
the the tradition of

947
00:50:05,729 --> 00:50:05,739
a

948
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:06,239
Thomas K

949
00:50:06,439 --> 00:50:09,510
on scientific paradigms where there is incommensurability.

950
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,909
Um There's a period of crisis and scientific revolution.

951
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,070
Uh And I,

952
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,139
I wanted to offer a different story where it was

953
00:50:17,149 --> 00:50:20,850
really an invitation of not to think of scientific perspectives as

954
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,439
siloed.

955
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:26,239
Uh but to think of those communities and their

956
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:29,729
interaction in terms of what I call intersecting and interlacing

957
00:50:30,209 --> 00:50:31,739
scientific perspectives,

958
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,860
perspectives that over time,

959
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:38,199
not only methodological intersect to allow us to make more

960
00:50:38,209 --> 00:50:41,399
reliable inferences about the phenomenon that we want to study.

961
00:50:41,969 --> 00:50:46,790
But also over time, historically interlace like the um

962
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,979
like in a fabric,

963
00:50:48,989 --> 00:50:50,179
like in a piece of cloth where you

964
00:50:50,189 --> 00:50:53,310
have the different threads that are historically interlaced

965
00:50:53,870 --> 00:50:58,899
uh to produce knowledge that effectively is knowledge that we can reclaim as, as,

966
00:50:58,909 --> 00:51:00,239
as knowledge that belong

967
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:02,379
to all of us. And obviously

968
00:51:02,899 --> 00:51:08,189
that open up also the question questions about when is the interlacing virtues?

969
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:12,479
When is the interlacing going badly wrong? Because there are exploitative

970
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:17,360
practices or epistemic injustices in the way in which some communities

971
00:51:17,469 --> 00:51:23,000
appropriate other communities types of knowledge. So whose knowledge is it?

972
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,080
Who, who can be

973
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:29,570
uh uh uh attributed authorship of particular uh knowledge claims?

974
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:33,600
So those are all very big questions that I try to simply really

975
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:37,149
map out in the final chapter and I hope to get back to.

976
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,179
But the idea is that starting with

977
00:51:40,189 --> 00:51:43,300
this perspective of pluralism and multiculturalism,

978
00:51:43,939 --> 00:51:48,919
we can articulate a picture about scientific knowledge as reliable knowledge

979
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,909
uh that has to address important epistemic injustice about

980
00:51:52,919 --> 00:51:56,060
what I call the severing and trademarking of knowledge.

981
00:51:56,659 --> 00:51:57,919
And at the same time,

982
00:51:57,929 --> 00:52:04,280
has to result in a broader picture of how knowledge is really knowledge produced

983
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:10,979
by uh uh by humankind for humankind. So that no one should be excluded from

984
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:12,189
benefiting

985
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,909
from it and benefiting from the advances of scientific knowledge.

986
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,310
So it kind of branches out into debates about the

987
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:22,949
uh right to science as a uh as a right

988
00:52:22,959 --> 00:52:26,350
that is enshrined in the UN Declaration of Human rights.

989
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,310
So everyone

990
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:28,229
is

991
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:33,909
uh should benefit from um scientific progress and scientific advancement,

992
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:36,629
but it's obviously not what happens in practice.

993
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:38,830
The scientific knowledge continues to be privatized,

994
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:40,709
continues to be in the hands of um

995
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,229
few wealthy countries.

996
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,959
So um as I said it as a final chapter that um I

997
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:51,090
hope to get back to in terms of my present and future work.

998
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,000
But it kind of shows the broader

999
00:52:53,189 --> 00:52:53,860
um

1000
00:52:54,669 --> 00:52:55,320
um

1001
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,209
kind of social

1002
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:59,280
political dimensions in which discussions about pluralism

1003
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:01,649
and perspective is and realism play out.

1004
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,969
And so my final question for today will be,

1005
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:12,629
is science really about producing objective knowledge

1006
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:16,580
or knowing what objective reality is?

1007
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:23,699
Yes, is the answer in so far as we are clear about what we mean by objective reality,

1008
00:53:23,709 --> 00:53:24,090
right?

1009
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:24,600
So

1010
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:28,939
uh if objective reality means that there is one way

1011
00:53:28,949 --> 00:53:32,419
and one way only to uh carving natural disjoint,

1012
00:53:32,429 --> 00:53:35,020
I mean, that's not what perspective of realism

1013
00:53:35,409 --> 00:53:36,830
would subscribe to.

1014
00:53:37,129 --> 00:53:42,439
Uh but by objective reality, we mean that there is a world of stable events,

1015
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:43,800
Koli events

1016
00:53:44,209 --> 00:53:49,560
uh to which our uh multifarious inferential practices have to respond.

1017
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:51,530
That's, that's objective enough.

1018
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,330
And so, yes, scientific knowledge,

1019
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:57,110
knowledge of objective reality within the bounds of

1020
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,590
uh the

1021
00:53:59,129 --> 00:54:01,030
historical and cultural situated

1022
00:54:01,399 --> 00:54:02,629
practices

1023
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:06,790
that we have, we don't have any God's eye view, we don't have any view from nowhere.

1024
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:09,770
But that doesn't mean that what we have is just um a

1025
00:54:10,149 --> 00:54:13,030
fragmented landscape of isolated

1026
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:16,360
communities. What we have is a fairly remarkable

1027
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:20,320
uh knowledge produced over time by different communities.

1028
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:21,520
And I think it's something that

1029
00:54:21,979 --> 00:54:24,949
uh I wanted to celebrate in, in, in the book.

1030
00:54:24,959 --> 00:54:28,979
And uh as I said, it kind of opens up broader questions about

1031
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:32,820
um who produces knowledge and who should benefit from knowledge that

1032
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:36,760
is entangled in my mind with these questions about objective reality.

1033
00:54:37,439 --> 00:54:37,949
Mhm.

1034
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:39,080
Great.

1035
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:43,860
So uh I'm leaving a link to the book in the description box of the interview,

1036
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:45,350
which is again, perspective of

1037
00:54:45,459 --> 00:54:46,750
realism.

1038
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,419
Uh Doctor Massimi, just before we go,

1039
00:54:49,429 --> 00:54:54,050
would you like to tell people where they can find you and your work on the internet?

1040
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:58,929
