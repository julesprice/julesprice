Hello, everybody. Welcome to a new episode of the Decent. I'm your host, Ricardo

1
00:00:05,349 --> 00:00:08,060
Loops. And today I'm joined by Doctor Lydia Moland.

2
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:13,109
She's a professor of Philosophy at Colby College in Waterville Maine in the US.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,170
She has written extensively on 19th century German philosophy.

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,159
And more recently, she has also been interested in abolitionism in the US.

5
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:29,870
And she wrote a book titled Lydia Maria Child, a Radical American Life based on

6
00:00:30,209 --> 00:00:33,310
the American evolutionist with the same name.

7
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:37,389
So, Doctor Moland, welcome to the show. It's a big pleasure to everyone.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,450
Thank you.

9
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:41,189
It's a pleasure to be invited and I'm looking forward to our conversation.

10
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:42,830
OK.

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,659
So,

12
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:46,150
uh I would like to start by talking

13
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,500
about your work on 19th century German philosophy.

14
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,659
So, first of all,

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,430
why did you get interested specifically in 19th century German philosophy?

16
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:02,979
And do you think that if anything, there's

17
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:08,160
uh specific aspects of it that make it distinct from

18
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:13,569
other kinds of philosophy, from other places and other time periods?

19
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:15,750
Yes. Thank you for that.

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,669
Um I got interested in German 19th century philosophy through Spinoza.

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,550
So I took a very general philosophy course as an undergraduate.

22
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,589
Uh and I had intended to be a political science major,

23
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:31,790
but I read Spinoza and it just blew my mind and I,

24
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:33,459
I was so

25
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:39,949
moved by the vision that Spinoza had of holism and of um and,

26
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,220
and the way he argued that I decided to do more philosophy and ended up

27
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,309
in a course that ended with

28
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:46,970
Kant.

29
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:49,690
And I think as many people do

30
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:53,139
finished with some very deep dissatisfactions with

31
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,129
Kant's dualism and with his rationalism.

32
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,809
And someone said to me, well, if you are impatient with Kant,

33
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,669
maybe you should try Hegel.

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,029
Uh So the next semester,

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,690
I took a course on the Phenomenology of Spirit and then I was just hooked.

36
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:08,679
Um and I

37
00:02:09,018 --> 00:02:13,348
ended up going to Tubingen in Germany where Hegel himself studied,

38
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:17,798
I lived there for a couple of years and really immersed myself in the

39
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:22,798
culture of that particular time period. So

40
00:02:23,289 --> 00:02:25,479
many of your viewers will know that Tubing in is

41
00:02:25,488 --> 00:02:29,548
also where Holderlin lived and studied and also shelling.

42
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:35,059
So Hagel was there in this incredibly fertile environment where

43
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,449
people were taking

44
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,270
very seriously.

45
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:38,990
Spinoza

46
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:41,460
was still essentially forbidden.

47
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,470
He was still considered too controversial and too heretical to take seriously.

48
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,429
But they were all

49
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:49,860
sort of closet spin assists.

50
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:54,690
And um I, I found all of that very intriguing. I think what,

51
00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:57,580
what really pulled me into Hagel was

52
00:02:57,589 --> 00:03:01,210
his attempt to make philosophical sense of religion

53
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,699
and of protestantism.

54
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,399
In particularly I came from a protestant background and was really intrigued by

55
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:08,600
his attempt to show what was

56
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,089
important and

57
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:15,820
vital about the protestant worldview without attaching it

58
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,820
to a kind of uh religious literalism.

59
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,679
Um So that was, that was very helpful to me,

60
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,339
even just in thinking through my own philosophical questions.

61
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,029
So as far as what makes that period distinct, um

62
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:35,809
a couple of things come to mind, again, sort of connected to Spinoza. I think

63
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,229
the, again, this idea of holism, the attempt not to

64
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:46,250
think of philosophy as just addressing one problem or

65
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:49,210
focusing on just epistemology or just in the physics.

66
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,639
But

67
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,990
the idea that an idea could possibly explain

68
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,149
kind of everything.

69
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:57,210
Um

70
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,830
I think characterizes a lot of early 19th century philosophy in Germany,

71
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,899
certainly not later.

72
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:04,850
But

73
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,600
sometimes when I teach students this,

74
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:09,000
I find that, that,

75
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:11,789
that claim is really strange to them that there could

76
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,919
be one answer or one idea that could explain everything.

77
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,488
But I sometimes push back on that and say,

78
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,170
wouldn't it be even stranger

79
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:25,209
if different parts of the reality or of

80
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,799
philosophy were totally unconnected from each other?

81
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,790
I wouldn't it be sort of strange if

82
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:35,250
nature functions in a completely different way from art

83
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:38,640
or from politics or from epistemology? So,

84
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:44,700
isn't there something even just more intellectually consistent about looking for

85
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,190
an idea that could explain most of

86
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,140
human experience and maybe even nonhuman experience?

87
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:53,589
So that's one

88
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:58,470
another, I think a lot of really existential

89
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:05,000
questions get started in the 19th century. So you see that some in Kant for sure.

90
00:05:05,869 --> 00:05:07,760
But I think it took this

91
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,040
generation of thinkers who grew up in the French revolution,

92
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:17,170
which meant that everything they thought they knew about the way politics could

93
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,809
and should work

94
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,049
were um was, was challenged.

95
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:25,040
And then there were great hopes around the French revolution

96
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:28,890
and then they were dashed. And so this was a generation that really grew up

97
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,320
feeling the existential weight of a major historical

98
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:36,320
disappointment if you were a young person in that

99
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,600
generation.

100
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,549
Um And, and so the combination I think of K

101
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,570
turn towards the subject,

102
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:48,450
which really gives an individual subject an enormous amount of power.

103
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,320
And therefore, also responsibility

104
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,350
opens up these big existential questions and then living in

105
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:59,750
this part of history where there are enormous shifts um

106
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:03,829
that ask questions like what is the role of politics

107
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,459
and what is the role of the individual in politics?

108
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:08,640
And how do individuals

109
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,720
assert themselves in the face of great historical forces?

110
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,220
Um Those set the stage for the kinds of grappling with,

111
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:22,779
what does it mean to be an individual? What does it mean to be alienated in a society?

112
00:06:22,929 --> 00:06:24,989
Um Obviously something that's been picked up by

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,140
Marx and then more by Kirkegaard and Nietzsche

114
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,709
later in the century.

115
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:33,290
Um And then I would also say, and, and this is clearly in part because of my own work,

116
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,500
a real reorientation around art

117
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,829
and around aesthetic experience.

118
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,799
So that certainly gets started in Kant with his taking

119
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:47,769
seriously aesthetic experience is one of the most important things about

120
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,320
human experience.

121
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,600
Um But then when you get to people like Hegel,

122
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:54,299
but also very much his contemporaries like

123
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:54,545
Lael

124
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:55,575
or Novalis,

125
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:56,795
Bettina von Ar

126
00:06:57,114 --> 00:06:57,994
Carlina Von Gunder

127
00:06:58,184 --> 00:06:58,334
Rode.

128
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,424
Um some of these other people who saw in

129
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:07,065
art and then also in nature and our aesthetic responses to nature,

130
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:10,225
really central truths about

131
00:07:10,494 --> 00:07:11,454
the human condition.

132
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:11,725
Then I,

133
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:14,975
I think you get something very interesting that lasts throughout the century

134
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:18,355
in part because I think one way I try to think about it is

135
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:25,980
the question, what if art far from being derivative or entertaining

136
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:29,019
or the thing that we can philosophize about

137
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,019
kind of if we get to it?

138
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,100
What if instead it is the thing,

139
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,820
the thing that that can explain

140
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:38,820
us to ourselves and the world to

141
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:43,220
ourselves better than other branches of philosophy.

142
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,779
If that's true,

143
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:50,820
then a lot of things need to be revolved um sort in any kind of revolution

144
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,410
so that I'll stop there.

145
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:56,140
But those are a couple of the things that I find really compelling and possibly

146
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,489
um I don't know, unique but certainly

147
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,730
indicative of that period in that place in the world.

148
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,100
OK.

149
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:06,109
So I have to tell you straight away that the three

150
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:11,470
German philosophers whose work I'm most familiar with are Kent Nietzsche

151
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,480
and Schopenhauer. So

152
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,309
uh probably because of some of my personality traits.

153
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,269
I don't know exactly why, but those are the three I felt most

154
00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:22,799
compelled about.

155
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,359
And, uh, I mean, but, uh, of course,

156
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,720
I guess that

157
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:34,937
we could pretty much say that, uh, everyone in the 19th century in German was

158
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:39,256
to some extent influenced by Kent. Right?

159
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:43,857
I mean, even the ones who rejected most of his philosophy or some,

160
00:08:43,866 --> 00:08:47,057
or parts of his philosophy, like for example,

161
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,807
Schopenhauer and Nietzsche,

162
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:49,768
Nietzsche,

163
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:55,455
to a greater extent, even them were very, very much influenced by Kent. I,

164
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:56,426
I think we could

165
00:08:57,346 --> 00:09:02,765
and of course, uh I mean, it's not that German philosophy in the 19th centuries

166
00:09:02,895 --> 00:09:08,916
is a monolith, like for example, sometimes people talk about German idealism,

167
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:11,916
but I mean, you get into figures like

168
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:13,375
Schopenhauer and Nietzsche

169
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:17,536
and they were extremely different from

170
00:09:17,945 --> 00:09:21,314
can or what you would consider just

171
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:23,443
general idealism. Nietzsche

172
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:26,734
particularly sometimes is classified as a

173
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:32,653
romantic or rationalist and he certainly rejected

174
00:09:33,013 --> 00:09:33,343
many

175
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:34,513
aspects

176
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:36,693
of Kent's philosophy. And

177
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:41,794
Schopenhauer was very much a pessimist for example. So,

178
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:48,351
uh but I mean, do you think that we could look uh even with those differences?

179
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:52,791
And of course, we could talk about the other philosophers and they certainly have

180
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:58,851
m many distinct things about their philosophical corpus, I think. But

181
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:04,361
uh do you think that e even with all of those differences

182
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:08,892
and existentialism also that I didn't mention and all of that,

183
00:10:09,229 --> 00:10:15,969
that we can still find recurrent themes in 19th century German philosophy.

184
00:10:17,309 --> 00:10:18,549
Yeah, I mean, I,

185
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:25,309
I think one really is the struggle with the nature of subjectivity and what it means.

186
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,640
Epistemological, metaphysically, politically, aesthetically.

187
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:32,599
Uh What does it mean

188
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,320
to be a self?

189
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:37,539
And like if you think not to oversimplify,

190
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:40,010
but if you think about someone like Descartes just saying, well,

191
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,400
the self is a thinking thing.

192
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:43,559
It's essentially an immaterial substance.

193
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:49,010
Um its essence is just to think and it subsists as a thinking thing.

194
00:10:49,489 --> 00:10:50,179
Um

195
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:54,559
You know, a quick contrast to Kant, I think is

196
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:58,039
Kant's idea of this self as an activity.

197
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,539
So as something that is actively synthesizing whatever is coming at it

198
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,099
and that it only achieves selfhood through

199
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:08,539
being active.

200
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:09,659
And I think

201
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:14,890
in a way, one of the questions that survives all the way through the century then is

202
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:17,780
um what kind of activity is that?

203
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,159
And what does the basis of thinking through subjectivity?

204
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:25,500
Um mean for objectivity

205
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,260
and for reality and for how we treat other people

206
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:32,739
and obviously paired with that is the

207
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,619
question of whether there is a transcendent divine

208
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,090
that humans are beholden to or created by

209
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:42,099
and who

210
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,380
dictates reality as we see it. And in my opinion, Hagel, for instance,

211
00:11:47,729 --> 00:11:51,820
is trying very hard to reorient us from that

212
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:55,820
to seeing that humans are the only creators of meaning

213
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:58,299
and that we only create meaning

214
00:11:59,119 --> 00:11:59,750
in

215
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:02,460
cooper operation with each other.

216
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:03,380
So there's,

217
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,260
if you think about kind as primarily thinking of the subject as activity.

218
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:07,729
Hagel,

219
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:09,309
I think picks that up but with a

220
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,489
much stronger emphasis on the kind of mutual recognition

221
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:14,739
that's necessary

222
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:16,070
to think about

223
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:20,789
my being a subject is dependent on your recognizing me as a subject.

224
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,059
And only when we recognize each other, not just abs as abstract subjects,

225
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:30,710
but as subjects embodied in different roles and different

226
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:33,729
areas of history, different life plans.

227
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:37,320
Can we really treat each other with the dignity and respect

228
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,070
that Kant had originally said we owed each other.

229
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:46,359
And so I think like if you follow that trajectory out um and start to think about like

230
00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:46,510
Kirke

231
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:48,659
guards grappling with what it meant

232
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,390
to be a subject kind of at odds with

233
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,539
um

234
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,320
with the conventional world or norms that were

235
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,679
established by a society that he didn't feel

236
00:13:02,109 --> 00:13:02,700
um

237
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,539
acknowledged by. And then someone like Nietzsche,

238
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,150
who I think is even more

239
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:10,450
expressly celebrating

240
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:16,299
the agony and the ecstasy of being a self creating subject.

241
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:17,190
So I think in, in Nietzsche

242
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,669
much more than in Hegel,

243
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,080
you get again the existential.

244
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,190
Yeah, I'll say it again,

245
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,330
agony and ecstasy of the fact that we have to create

246
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,500
our own meaning where we can't rely on the divine or on

247
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:38,630
nature as something separate from us to tell us what is meaningful,

248
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,969
we have to do it ourselves.

249
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:40,539
And that

250
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,359
um is a great privilege and honor,

251
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:47,369
but also an enormous responsibility that I think in Nietzsche's

252
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:52,849
view more than in Hagel's only some people are really up to shouldering.

253
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:54,289
So in, in each of them,

254
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:56,330
you get the sense that lots of people would just really

255
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:01,229
rather prefer to have others tell them what is meaningful.

256
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,530
Um And our calling is to resist that.

257
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,080
I think Hagel, for instance, is much less interested in that kind of resistance

258
00:14:09,229 --> 00:14:11,229
and more interested in trying to think of

259
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:14,250
ourselves as a cooperating group of people,

260
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,159
each with our own subjectivities.

261
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:19,869
But working out our subjectivity and our bid for

262
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,590
freedom very much with each other as opposed to

263
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,869
in the kind of individualistic way that you get

264
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:26,609
with Nietzsche.

265
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:30,539
That subjectivity part.

266
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:32,450
I mean, what I'm going to say now,

267
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:36,549
if I say something that you don't agree with or you think is incorrect,

268
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:37,940
please correct me.

269
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,260
But

270
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:41,979
uh I mean, of course, in someone like Nietzsche

271
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,909
and is

272
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,700
to some extent, perspect perspective is philosophy because he,

273
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:53,340
he particularly in beyond good and evil, for example.

274
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:57,770
And when and when it comes to morality more specifically,

275
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:02,369
there, there are places in his work where he expresses a very

276
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,510
uh perspective

277
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,859
perspective on,

278
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:15,710
on things uh uh and things seem to be very dependent on the subject and subjectivity.

279
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:16,080
But

280
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:22,030
uh I mean, uh don't you think that even in Kent, particularly when

281
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,900
uh in the critic of purism, he talks about, for example,

282
00:15:28,229 --> 00:15:29,400
the limits

283
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,190
of, of our

284
00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:31,940
uh

285
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:37,950
o of the information we can get from our senses, the

286
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,919
uh th those kinds of limits and,

287
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:48,679
and also the fact that we uh sort of uh have some sort of categories of understanding.

288
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,349
And I think that some of them,

289
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,429
they, it takes from,

290
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:55,900
I guess Aristotle, if I'm not mistaken and

291
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:57,549
expands on them, I mean,

292
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,900
the a and then the, and then also when he gets into the, the

293
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,559
antinomy and he talks about

294
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:06,239
the things that even

295
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:12,219
as through a reasoning process cannot fully answer.

296
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:15,669
Like for example, if there's life after death, if there's a God,

297
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,929
if the universe is infinite in time and space questions like that.

298
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,950
Uh I, I mean, that isn't there,

299
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:29,510
even if only a tiny seed of subjectivity planted there because

300
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:30,049
I mean,

301
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:37,429
it seems that there's the thing in itself or whatever reality is

302
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,080
and then our own limitations as human subjects when it comes to

303
00:16:42,359 --> 00:16:44,919
perceiving it and getting

304
00:16:45,229 --> 00:16:48,500
an objective understanding

305
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:53,859
of what it is. I, I mean, I, I don't know, what are your thoughts on this?

306
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,419
Yeah, absolutely. I think that's 100% right? And I think

307
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,809
that's a

308
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,380
kind of radical

309
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:04,469
postulate that I don't even think

310
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,550
Kant felt the existential weight of

311
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,329
which is to say

312
00:17:10,608 --> 00:17:11,868
it took someone.

313
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,670
Well, I, I, I'm much more familiar with the early romantics, you know, the

314
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,530
Schlegel and,

315
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,640
and Schelling and, and Novalis and Gunter

316
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:19,819
Rode

317
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:21,239
and people like that

318
00:17:21,358 --> 00:17:23,069
who took that.

319
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,650
I, I just feel like much more to heart and as you say,

320
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,089
I think it is partly dispositional or generational

321
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,719
that, you know, can have laid those things out fairly matter of factly.

322
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:39,770
But I think that the consequences for how we think about our role in,

323
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,010
on our responsibility in the world and the radical perspect

324
00:17:43,489 --> 00:17:45,939
nature of that, as you say, um

325
00:17:46,329 --> 00:17:50,219
was really exhilarating and upsetting to

326
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:53,780
more to the next generation of thinkers.

327
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,920
So getting into Hegel

328
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,319
and specifically, of course, you've already said a few things about him, but

329
00:18:01,469 --> 00:18:06,319
getting specifically to into aesthetics because when we think about Hegel,

330
00:18:06,589 --> 00:18:13,550
I mean, people who are not philosophers and not specifically very familiar with

331
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,300
Hegel's philosophy,

332
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,819
we tend to just think about his more

333
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:23,420
systematic and abstract approaches to history and uh

334
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:25,550
uh thesis,

335
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:25,930
antithesis

336
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,140
synthesis and stuff like that.

337
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:33,130
But he also in fact wrote about aesthetics.

338
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:38,010
Yes. And that was part of his system for sure.

339
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,550
So um aesthetics is the first part of absolute spirit.

340
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,290
So if you think of, of, you know, the system writ large, you've got

341
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:47,250
um you know,

342
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,160
subjective spirit and the first you have logic and then you

343
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,209
have philosophy of nature and then in philosophy of spirit,

344
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,660
you first have subjective spirit and then

345
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,130
objective spirit and then absolute spirit.

346
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,290
Absolute spirit is where Hagel talks about the three ways that

347
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:07,969
he thinks humans grapple with what it means to be human.

348
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:10,849
So the ways in which we reflect on

349
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:12,040
um

350
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,290
on the world, but also on our role in the world.

351
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,130
So the first of those is art and then religion and then

352
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,680
being a philosopher, Hagel always has philosophy win at the end.

353
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:25,489
So philosophy for Hagel is still

354
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,689
the best

355
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:31,229
um most complete and most explicit way that humans

356
00:19:31,239 --> 00:19:35,310
reckon with their um their own status and ask themselves

357
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,260
about meaning in the world.

358
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,140
But art has a really important place in that

359
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,750
for Hagel because we are embodied sensual beings.

360
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,310
And contrary to what some people think about Hagel,

361
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,660
he doesn't regret that.

362
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:55,739
I mean, it isn't that if we could, we should get rid of that part of ourselves.

363
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,770
I think he thinks that that's a very rich and very vital

364
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:04,189
way in which humans remain part of the natural world. So we continue to

365
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,459
feel and smell and hear things um that are outside of us. But

366
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,660
we also use our senses to create things that then mean something to us

367
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,319
and that reflect our own grappling with that meaning.

368
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,319
So

369
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:24,010
I think that for Hegel, aesthetics

370
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,040
is

371
00:20:25,699 --> 00:20:29,579
the sensuous way of experiencing truth.

372
00:20:29,949 --> 00:20:35,589
So truth for Hegel again, back to Spinoza is this very holistic view of

373
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,099
the identity of identity and difference.

374
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,640
So he says the true is the whole,

375
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,979
it's the thing that brings together contraries

376
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:46,180
and this is where people get the thesis

377
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:48,119
sis synthesis um

378
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,500
theme that you just referred to.

379
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,819
And so art is the way that we can

380
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,650
sense that truth through our senses as opposed to

381
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:03,869
understanding it through narratives, which is the way

382
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,209
Hegel characterizes religion. So

383
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,050
interestingly,

384
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,719
religion for him is primarily about narrative

385
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,079
stories that we tell ourselves to explain

386
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:15,250
everything from the origin of the world to

387
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,040
um you know, our own relationship to each other through.

388
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,510
And then philosophy is supposed to do

389
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,969
that without narrative and without our senses.

390
00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:23,969
So just through thought.

391
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,869
So then within aesthetics, Hagel's

392
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:29,260
project is to say

393
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,849
how art does that

394
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:37,569
and which kinds of art and which particular instances of art do that best?

395
00:21:37,579 --> 00:21:39,489
So for him, the question always is,

396
00:21:39,939 --> 00:21:45,510
is this particular art form or this particular artwork allowing us to sense

397
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,839
the idea

398
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,689
which is the unity of unity and division or the true? That is the whole.

399
00:21:52,199 --> 00:21:55,099
So he does this um in a couple of ways.

400
00:21:55,109 --> 00:21:58,010
Um One by giving what some people call

401
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,130
the first really philosophical history of art.

402
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,880
I always think people are too quick to assign

403
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,089
first to anything and usually when they do that,

404
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:09,660
it's to a male European philosopher.

405
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,060
And I think that is often not true. So I try to be

406
00:22:13,439 --> 00:22:14,719
skeptical about that.

407
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:16,780
Um but whether he was first or not,

408
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:22,579
he certainly had a very influential idea of the sort of history and progress of art.

409
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:26,069
So that's in what's part two of his lectures

410
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,280
on the philosophy of art.

411
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:32,270
And then he has a whole part three and I'm happy to get into it. This is one of my

412
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:36,000
major claims in my book on Hagel's aesthetics is that

413
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,890
part three has been essentially neglected by HGL scholars.

414
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:43,349
But that's where he talks about what he calls individual arts,

415
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,040
which are architecture,

416
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,359
sculpture, painting,

417
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,390
music, and poetry. Importantly, in that order,

418
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,209
because that's the order in which Hagel thinks he can

419
00:22:54,219 --> 00:22:59,119
explain how humans increasingly come to take ownership of their own

420
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,790
um art. So I'm happy to talk about that later.

421
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:04,390
But anyway, so that's that in general

422
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,369
um is where

423
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,709
aesthetics and the philosophy of art fits in Hegel's system.

424
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:11,040
And the,

425
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:13,479
the other big claim that I make in my book on

426
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:18,890
Hagel's aesthetics is that we learn so much about Hagel's idealism

427
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,790
through his aesthetics.

428
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,500
So it's not just that OK, we get Hagel's system and then when we have time,

429
00:23:25,719 --> 00:23:28,969
we can do the aesthetics. But if we don't understand the aesthetics,

430
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,739
we don't understand really crucial things about Hagel's theory of selfhood,

431
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,369
about feeling about perception, like

432
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,319
things that, that people usually talk about under the heading of, you know,

433
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:42,219
metaphysics or epistemology.

434
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:46,119
Um But I think there's a lot to learn about those more traditional fields. Um

435
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,380
Well, see, I shouldn't even say traditional fields because that,

436
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,140
that wasn't the case in Hegel's generation

437
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,170
that people thought that metaphysics and

438
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,930
epistemology were like the core philosophical

439
00:23:57,199 --> 00:24:00,569
um enterprises and aesthetics was just derivative really

440
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:01,930
the opposite.

441
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,579
Um So it's more because of the way philosophy developed,

442
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:06,459
especially in the early 20th century

443
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:09,979
that we've come to think that um again, so part of what I'm,

444
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:14,540
what I try to do here is, is, is reorient us towards thinking about it the other way.

445
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:19,209
So there's something that you mentioned there that I would like to get more into.

446
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:23,709
So, and, and please correct me if I'm wrong. But it seems then that

447
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:26,760
in a way uh the way Hegel

448
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:29,050
approaches aesthetics,

449
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:29,819
I mean,

450
00:24:29,829 --> 00:24:34,540
it's not as some sort of a separate field

451
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:38,510
or domain from all the other domains of philosophy,

452
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,219
like epistemology, probably ethics and metaphysics because

453
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:45,339
uh I mean, isn't it also

454
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:45,770
that

455
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:51,060
as Hegel uh understands art and aesthetics more generally,

456
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:56,540
that it ties very much to epistemology for example,

457
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:02,349
and how we understand the world and how we acquire knowledge about it.

458
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,750
Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely.

459
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:10,859
So we don't, there are things that we can only sort of know through our senses.

460
00:25:10,869 --> 00:25:14,310
So that's an epistemological question. And there are ways in which

461
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,670
our status as embodied beings

462
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:25,010
can only be known to us through our senses. And so if we don't talk about

463
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,290
art,

464
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,410
we're not talking about a key part of epistemology.

465
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,910
And I think that Hagel has a pretty clear sense that our senses are, uh

466
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:36,459
again, it's not,

467
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:39,599
sometimes people think that Hagel thinks that we'd be best if

468
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:42,660
we were disembodied and I just think that's absolutely false.

469
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:45,819
Um So, in so far as part of what we know

470
00:25:45,989 --> 00:25:50,660
is embodied and there is such a thing as embodied knowledge, this is where we get

471
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,780
it, we get it through aesthetics. And I should say,

472
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,439
you know, strangely, especially coming after

473
00:25:56,699 --> 00:26:01,579
Kant and Shelling Hegel is completely uninterested in natural beauty.

474
00:26:01,589 --> 00:26:03,989
Like he just doesn't even really want to talk about it.

475
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,890
Um

476
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:05,579
He,

477
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:08,849
he is almost exclusively interested in the philosophy of

478
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:12,579
art and in aesthetics as an artistic phenomenon.

479
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:14,849
Um But other people have certainly

480
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:18,510
talked a lot more about our aesthetic appreciation of nature.

481
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,050
And Schiller is a great example of that.

482
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,739
And it's always been very surprising to me that Hagel doesn't

483
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,689
engage with that conversation in Schiller more than he does.

484
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:32,530
Um But yes, absolutely. Um So like to give you an example when he talks about music,

485
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,770
music for

486
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:39,099
Hegel is the way we sense time.

487
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,239
And if you think about Kant,

488
00:26:41,449 --> 00:26:44,040
talking about time is one of the two oper

489
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:47,540
intuitions through which that is necessary to our

490
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,420
understanding the world and having experience at all.

491
00:26:51,199 --> 00:26:56,500
For Hegel. Music is the thing that in the, in the most pure sense allows us

492
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:59,099
to sense time

493
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,969
and since time is so critical to selfhood, so there's no selfhood without time

494
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:12,900
in a way. He thinks that music allows us to sense the self. I mean, it doesn't get more

495
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,270
root epistemological and metaphysical than that.

496
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:23,130
So what, what music allows us to do is have this very pure sense

497
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,729
of what is

498
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,619
so purely part of our existence, namely time.

499
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:33,810
And that Hagel thinks is why music literally

500
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:35,239
moves us,

501
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,050
I mean, literally and metaphorically. So you can be moved by music emotionally.

502
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,939
But Hagel himself says that

503
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,560
sometimes without knowing it, we'll start tapping our feet

504
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,280
when or moving our body.

505
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,979
I love that image of Hagel it like, you know,

506
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:53,699
we tended to give him as such a serious German philosopher and he was.

507
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:58,010
But um but he himself recognizing that sometimes he couldn't help but move,

508
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:02,579
you know, that that's really uh deep, deep knowledge of ourselves.

509
00:28:02,589 --> 00:28:03,199
And again,

510
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:05,790
the knowledge without which I think Hagel thinks

511
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,310
our own understanding of ourselves would be impoverished.

512
00:28:09,489 --> 00:28:10,890
That's all very interesting.

513
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,219
I mean,

514
00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:14,239
oo one of the things that I find fascinating

515
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:19,319
about some philosophers is that nowadays through science,

516
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:24,660
we are confirming some of their ideas or intuitions, things that they've arrived at

517
00:28:24,939 --> 00:28:32,359
uh without uh II, I mean, not through science as at least as we understand it today,

518
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:33,089
of course.

519
00:28:33,239 --> 00:28:36,280
But for example, when you were talking there about

520
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:41,150
uh embodiment and embodied knowledge, I mean, nowadays,

521
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,640
we have an entire field of embodied

522
00:28:43,775 --> 00:28:47,275
cognition and how we acquire knowledge

523
00:28:47,604 --> 00:28:52,675
through, not just through operations that occur in our brain,

524
00:28:52,685 --> 00:28:56,704
but through our brain being connected to the rest of our body and

525
00:28:56,844 --> 00:29:02,515
how we move in the world and the actions we do and how we interact with things. And

526
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,650
I, I mean, it's really fascinating to me and uh

527
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,650
I mean, as I said, I'm more familiar with people like Nietzsche,

528
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:10,739
but even Nietzsche,

529
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:15,040
we could say was very much a philosopher of action.

530
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:15,780
I mean, he,

531
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:19,989
he loved to walk a lot and thinking while

532
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,939
he was walking and he talked about doing philosopher,

533
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:26,079
philosophy with a hammer and,

534
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,530
and they very much admire people of action.

535
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,569
And I, I mean, doing things instead of just

536
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,599
sitting and

537
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:39,180
thinking and have this sort of more

538
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:42,160
platonic vision of things that

539
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:47,339
perhaps we could or should in a way try to disembody ourselves,

540
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,959
which in a way seems very,

541
00:29:50,199 --> 00:29:54,780
uh, uh, II, I mean, uh, the, there's a very interesting caricature of that.

542
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:57,260
I, I don't know if you ever watched the movie,

543
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,140
The Adventures Of Baron

544
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:01,050
Munchausen. But there's a,

545
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:07,180
there's a scene there played by Robin Williams where he's, uh,

546
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:12,760
uh, the king of the moon. I think it's the king of the moon, but the man on the moon

547
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,839
and he can separate his head from the rest

548
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:19,800
of the body just to try to become more enlightened

549
00:30:19,989 --> 00:30:24,890
and it doesn't really work. So I think it's a very,

550
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:31,300
uh, a very funny parody of that sort of, uh disembodied

551
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,260
idea of

552
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,060
nationality or

553
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,979
epistemology. So,

554
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,339
yeah.

555
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,579
Yeah. And I do think that Hagel, despite his reputation, also resisted that kind of

556
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,699
reification of reason and of the mind.

557
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:46,489
Um, and, you know,

558
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,420
there's a lot of that in his philosophy of

559
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,859
subjective spirit too when he talks about anthropology and

560
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:55,089
um in psychology and ways in which

561
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:58,560
our minds are very formed by what happens around us.

562
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:03,670
And it talks about insanity in those passages as being very much tied to our embodied

563
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,869
um existence. So there's, there's way more of that in

564
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,410
HGL than most people think. And

565
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,689
again, I think the aesthetics are a wonderful way

566
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,579
to get at that. I mean, I'll, I'll say one other thing about it. I think

567
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,660
part of what Hagel really appreciated about art is that

568
00:31:19,459 --> 00:31:22,170
we go through our everyday lives,

569
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:26,380
sensing things, but not being aware that we're sensing them.

570
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:32,310
So not being aware of ourselves as seeing and as hearing and as touching.

571
00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:34,829
And when we do that,

572
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:37,729
I think Hagel thinks we risk beginning to treat the

573
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:41,589
world as something that's just out there that's a given.

574
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:42,640
You know, so

575
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,079
mcdowell and Brandon have been talking about this for a very long time.

576
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:48,020
Mcdowell, especially the myth of the given, right?

577
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:50,959
So the world is out there and what epistemology is, is just our,

578
00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:57,630
like attaching our ideas to the outside world in uh in an accurate way.

579
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:03,410
And I think Hagel thinks that that that happens in part just out of habit, of course.

580
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:08,989
So when I walk by a tree, I can't every time think, wow, I'm seeing a tree.

581
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,089
And even though, you know, it seems this way from this perspective,

582
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,489
it's actually a different way from that.

583
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,280
Like I'd never get through my day.

584
00:32:16,719 --> 00:32:21,000
Um But what art does is remind us of what our

585
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:26,089
senses are doing by disrupting that in really interesting ways.

586
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:26,890
So,

587
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:30,229
and one example would be looking at a painting

588
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:31,949
and realizing

589
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,439
that I can see three dimensions where there aren't three dimensions.

590
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:41,630
And that tells me something about the interaction of my mind with the world.

591
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,310
So we might think of a painting is

592
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:46,209
a paradigmatic example of something that just exists

593
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,239
independently outside of us.

594
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,410
But actually for it to exist

595
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,150
as a painting,

596
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,949
there has to be someone looking at it and perceiving it in a certain way.

597
00:32:57,709 --> 00:33:02,569
And Hagel thinks that that kind of mutual formation between the self and the world

598
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,560
actually is what is true of us all day, every day.

599
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,069
But we get used to it,

600
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:10,969
it becomes and this is a really important technical term for him.

601
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,410
Prosaic,

602
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,930
right? We start to treat it as just sort of normal and given

603
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,069
and,

604
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:21,530
and, and as existing independently of us.

605
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:25,140
And what art reminds us is that in fact,

606
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:27,930
everything that we sense and everything that we do is

607
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:31,439
part of our mutual engagement and formation with the world.

608
00:33:31,739 --> 00:33:32,560
And I think

609
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,219
Hegel famously doesn't articulate a theory of

610
00:33:36,229 --> 00:33:38,729
aesthetic experience the way Khan does.

611
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,329
So, Kant says, you know,

612
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:44,339
it's the playing of the faculties and that's part of why it gives us pleasure is

613
00:33:44,349 --> 00:33:48,300
because it gives us a break from our kind of prosaic parsing of the world Hagel

614
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,170
doesn't ever actually say that.

615
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,780
But I think what he

616
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,300
implies is that when we

617
00:33:56,719 --> 00:34:00,420
are disrupted, out of our prosaic attitude towards the world

618
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:04,969
into a more aesthetic attitude towards it, we're actually sensing truth

619
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:07,300
in a way that we don't otherwise.

620
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:12,820
So if I go from just seeing the tree to having an aesthetic experience of the tree,

621
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:19,100
that's actually a more true experience of the tree. And that's part of what gives me

622
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,938
joy.

623
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:20,719
So

624
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,958
I think that's part of what Hagel thinks is going on

625
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,860
in all kinds of aesthetic pleasure.

626
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:32,330
So uh there was a point there uh in my previous question where you

627
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,080
mentioned the fact that at a certain point in his work on aesthetics,

628
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:40,250
Hegel talks about how humans can take

629
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:44,530
ownership of their art through specific kinds of

630
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,129
art. Could you tell us a little bit more about that?

631
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:51,030
Yeah. So this is behind his

632
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:56,628
trajectory from architecture to sculpture to what he calls

633
00:34:56,638 --> 00:34:58,868
or actually it's one of his um editors.

634
00:34:58,878 --> 00:35:04,128
But anyway, the three romantic arts which are painting music and poetry. So,

635
00:35:05,579 --> 00:35:07,408
and many other philosophers like

636
00:35:07,968 --> 00:35:13,198
Herder had put art into a different trajectory. So I think one really good way of

637
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:17,289
trying to figure out what Hagel is up to is to compare those and and you know,

638
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:19,769
why does he put what at the top?

639
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:28,899
Um So for Hegel architecture is the art form that feels most externalized to humans,

640
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:29,149
right?

641
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:29,560
So it's

642
00:35:29,689 --> 00:35:31,399
big in scope.

643
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:34,260
It's also usually functional, although he often,

644
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:36,669
he also talks about architecture that's not functional.

645
00:35:36,909 --> 00:35:37,479
Um

646
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,879
And it, it has to do primarily with matter

647
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:45,959
that seems independent of humans. So stone or brick or wood

648
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:54,409
and then sculpture also has a more um and an externalized material.

649
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:57,399
So whether that's marble or plaster or whatever,

650
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,030
but in sculpture, at least paradigmatic sculpture as Hagel understands it,

651
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,870
humans start to

652
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,570
reflect themselves in it.

653
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:12,280
So paradigmatic sculpture for Hegel is ancient Greek sculpture where um

654
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,679
humans are no longer making

655
00:36:16,129 --> 00:36:23,840
uh like monstrous, exaggerated forms, but more just straight up human forms.

656
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,179
So that's, that's more attention to the human and more attention to the subjective.

657
00:36:28,189 --> 00:36:30,899
And then when you get to painting music and poetry,

658
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,260
you're increasingly focusing humans attention on what's going

659
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:39,719
on inside of them as arts material.

660
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:41,500
So color

661
00:36:41,879 --> 00:36:43,790
doesn't, I mean, it's let me put it this way.

662
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,909
It's more obvious to us that color doesn't exist in

663
00:36:47,919 --> 00:36:51,439
the world the way that stone exists in the world.

664
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:51,600
OK.

665
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,570
So Hagel still doesn't think that we should

666
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,719
talk about stone as existing independently of us.

667
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,050
But leaving that aside,

668
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:06,580
painting more obviously points out to us our involvement in whatever is painted.

669
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:10,179
And so I already talked about like perspective, but that's true also of color.

670
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:11,699
And Hagel likes to talk about how

671
00:37:12,149 --> 00:37:15,939
it's possible for a human to see a form like a human,

672
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:22,149
not even by drawing, but just by juxtaposing colors against each other.

673
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:26,189
So even if there isn't a human form drawn, if you juxtapose the colors,

674
00:37:26,419 --> 00:37:28,350
a human will see

675
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:31,209
a drawing where there isn't one, right?

676
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:33,709
So again, more activity on the part of the subject

677
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:36,469
and then music, as I was saying a minute ago,

678
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,810
same thing. Music is totally interior, right?

679
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:44,110
So there we can't really talk about any material that's outside,

680
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,760
like we can talk about the instruments,

681
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,860
but the instruments aren't the music

682
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:52,699
and they certainly aren't my experience of the music. So that's

683
00:37:52,899 --> 00:37:54,229
totally interior

684
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,860
and then poetry.

685
00:37:56,870 --> 00:37:58,780
So Hagel and this is one of the the

686
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:00,610
interesting differences between Hagel and

687
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,439
other philosophers including Schopenhauer,

688
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:02,780
right?

689
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:06,979
So Schopenhauer puts music at the top because he wants really

690
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,300
to highlight

691
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,979
that kind of subjectivity. But Hagel is always interested in

692
00:38:13,129 --> 00:38:14,689
the unity of identity

693
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:18,659
and difference, right? So he doesn't want to stop at subjectivity.

694
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:20,399
He wants to go back to

695
00:38:20,649 --> 00:38:24,060
integrating subjectivity back into objectivity.

696
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:28,389
And so when we get to poetry, we have um

697
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,979
something that's 100% human creation, namely language

698
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,909
as material,

699
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,989
but it's,

700
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,750
it's not as subjective as music because language is something that you and I have to

701
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,469
agree on on some level.

702
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:48,270
Otherwise it wouldn't count as language if I just start, you know,

703
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,540
speaking gibberish,

704
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:53,139
that might be my private language,

705
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,969
but it's not going to function like language unless I'm in dialogue, literally,

706
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,360
not just with one person, but with a whole culture.

707
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,979
So then when we get to

708
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:04,620
as a kind of poetry,

709
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:08,090
which then embodies language as this very

710
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,739
human creation and this very mutually formed creation

711
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,219
back into action,

712
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,429
right? So then you have characters embodied characters back to embodiment,

713
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:25,010
embodied characters on a stage using language that's been mutually agreed upon,

714
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,850
not just between individuals but by a culture.

715
00:39:28,149 --> 00:39:29,610
Then Hagel thinks we've got a

716
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:36,449
really profound experience of collective aesthetic creation

717
00:39:36,659 --> 00:39:41,489
that can unite us as a community while also showcasing

718
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:45,189
the kind of subjectivity that a character like

719
00:39:45,399 --> 00:39:48,689
Antigone or Hamlet is experiencing.

720
00:39:49,139 --> 00:39:50,280
So, um

721
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:52,449
so that's the way in which Hagel,

722
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,229
that's why Hagel

723
00:39:54,379 --> 00:39:56,280
orders them the way he orders them

724
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,879
and decides that drama is the most complete form of aesthetic experience,

725
00:40:01,889 --> 00:40:03,020
which does not.

726
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,280
And we'll probably get to this in a minute. Um Mean that he thinks

727
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,229
that it's the best form of art,

728
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,959
but it is the highest aesthetic experience philosophically for humans.

729
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:17,020
You know, uh

730
00:40:17,149 --> 00:40:18,459
while you were talking,

731
00:40:18,469 --> 00:40:22,199
I was thinking at a certain point because you mentioned Schopenhauer there

732
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:25,000
that uh if um

733
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:31,000
uh I mean, of course, you probably already alluded to some of that in your answer. But

734
00:40:31,409 --> 00:40:35,770
uh I was wondering what extent Hegel's statics

735
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:39,590
also connects to his metaphysics because when you mentioned

736
00:40:39,729 --> 00:40:39,949
Schopenhauer,

737
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:41,820
I mean, Schopenhauer is um

738
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:45,159
a, at least for us more

739
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:50,600
modern contemporary people, it's a bit of a weird idea.

740
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:54,000
But uh if, if I understand it correctly. I think that,

741
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:00,159
uh OK, so, um Schopenhauer took that division from Kent,

742
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:02,239
uh the division between the Neuman

743
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,840
and, and the phenomenon

744
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:06,580
and the phenomenons uh the Ninon

745
00:41:06,919 --> 00:41:11,909
sorry, supposedly is what reality itself is.

746
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:15,560
I mean, the fundamental nature of reality. And

747
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,860
uh and this is also something I, I guess that Nietzsche talks about in the,

748
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:23,475
the origin of tragedy because back then in his first book,

749
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:27,784
he was already very much influenced by Schopenhauer.

750
00:41:27,794 --> 00:41:28,604
He then

751
00:41:28,764 --> 00:41:29,455
uh uh

752
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:34,475
left some of that out of his philosophy later on. But

753
00:41:34,774 --> 00:41:35,435
uh

754
00:41:35,915 --> 00:41:39,735
didn't Schopenhauer have this sort of idea that

755
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:45,195
music itself was part of the fundamental nature

756
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:46,514
of reality.

757
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:48,909
Yeah. Absolutely. And that,

758
00:41:49,399 --> 00:41:50,610
and for Schopenhauer,

759
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,310
the reason we love music so much and the reason it moves us

760
00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:00,330
so much is because it is the most raw experience of reality we can

761
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:01,110
get.

762
00:42:01,399 --> 00:42:05,989
And uh absolutely, it, it moves us because it is also, you know, and this is,

763
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,310
I think is, is the kind of thing Hagel thought too that

764
00:42:08,899 --> 00:42:14,399
the joy that we get in it and in and its immediate access to our emotions so that

765
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,479
music can make us sad

766
00:42:16,949 --> 00:42:17,959
about

767
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:18,959
nothing,

768
00:42:19,219 --> 00:42:19,370
right?

769
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:25,110
So it's not if I listen to sad music, I'm not sad about anything. I'm just sad.

770
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,110
That's incredible. Like the fact that that's possible.

771
00:42:28,919 --> 00:42:33,580
Schopenhauer thinks says something really profound about the nature

772
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:36,169
of reality and about the nature of being human.

773
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:39,580
And I think Hagel is attuned to that as well. And it doesn't

774
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,489
be again because he's more interested in

775
00:42:43,669 --> 00:42:47,929
thinking about a society in which people work together. I mean,

776
00:42:48,459 --> 00:42:48,889
Hagel,

777
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,010
I sometimes say to my students is just more

778
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,919
interested in like making sure that the society functions.

779
00:42:53,929 --> 00:42:55,909
And so he's, he's much more interested in saying, OK,

780
00:42:55,919 --> 00:43:00,409
what institutions are going to be necessary for us to create

781
00:43:00,419 --> 00:43:03,590
a society in which humans can live to their full potential.

782
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,570
And someone like Schopenhauer, as I understand him is,

783
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,899
is just much less interested in that.

784
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,719
So I think Hagel wants to pull back from this kind of ra

785
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:14,399
education of subjectivity and say, OK,

786
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:15,760
it's really good.

787
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,379
It's really important

788
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,709
fundamental to modern humans.

789
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:25,159
Now, we've got to show how it can be fostered within institutions.

790
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,179
And so I think that's part of why um

791
00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:31,250
music doesn't top the list for him

792
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:34,600
and to your original question about metaphysics. Absolutely.

793
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:38,580
I mean, this is the structure of reality as far as Hagel is concerned,

794
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:40,800
the identity of identity and difference.

795
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:44,250
And so the, the way in which the trajectory of the arts,

796
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,770
including music's subordinate place to drama

797
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,370
into poetry in general

798
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:51,500
is a

799
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,969
metaphysical commitment on Hagel's part. Absolutely.

800
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,669
Uh And uh I mean, you mentioned drama there.

801
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:05,469
Uh Did Hegel have specific views about tragedy and comedy?

802
00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:10,100
Yes, this is something I thought about a lot. Um

803
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:11,810
And

804
00:44:11,919 --> 00:44:14,010
probably many of your viewers will know that

805
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,399
Hagel is most famous for talking about tragedy.

806
00:44:16,409 --> 00:44:17,169
So his

807
00:44:17,479 --> 00:44:20,469
interpretation of antigone has been in particular,

808
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,709
very influential. And I mean,

809
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:27,229
the thousands of pages that have been written on that are testament to how,

810
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:31,550
how important and revelatory his theory of tragedy was.

811
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:31,870
But

812
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:35,929
um much less attention has been paid to his theory of comedy.

813
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,370
And so I got really interested in that at a certain point.

814
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:44,419
Um Both what Hagel says about comedy and why it has been um not taken as seriously,

815
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:49,149
really quick answer to the second question that's just really typical that

816
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:54,419
philosophers um tend to take serious things more seriously. And

817
00:44:54,649 --> 00:44:57,459
unless you want to take comedy seriously

818
00:44:57,469 --> 00:45:01,320
and therefore risk being comic yourself because

819
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,580
how ridiculous is it to take comedy seriously?

820
00:45:04,729 --> 00:45:09,959
Um People don't do it. I, I have uh spent probably more time in my life than I should

821
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,679
taking comedy very seriously. I teach a course on it. Um

822
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,860
And that, that is in part because I,

823
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:20,250
yeah, I got interested in what Hagel says about tragedy and comedy.

824
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:21,439
So in short,

825
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:23,600
and I'm much more focused on what he says about it in

826
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:26,719
his lectures on aesthetics rather than what he says in the phenomenology.

827
00:45:26,729 --> 00:45:27,810
But I do think they are,

828
00:45:28,179 --> 00:45:29,060
they are connected

829
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,830
tragedy for Hegel

830
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,469
shows a kind of subjectivity,

831
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:37,139
very

832
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:44,300
entrenched in itself and in roles in particular in like social roles.

833
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:45,600
So if you think about antigone,

834
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,620
she is struggling with her role as a daughter

835
00:45:50,199 --> 00:45:51,459
and as a sister

836
00:45:51,709 --> 00:45:53,449
and as a subject, right?

837
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,689
So her brothers have been killed, she wants to bury one of them.

838
00:45:56,699 --> 00:45:58,239
She feels that that's her duty.

839
00:45:58,459 --> 00:46:00,459
Her uncle, the king

840
00:46:00,629 --> 00:46:05,379
is also her king now and she's supposed to obey him and he forbids this, um,

841
00:46:05,389 --> 00:46:07,010
since one of her brothers was a traitor.

842
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,500
So the, the tragedy there is between

843
00:46:09,709 --> 00:46:12,379
two people who are deeply invested in their subjective

844
00:46:12,389 --> 00:46:16,459
relationships to their roles and those roles are incompatible.

845
00:46:16,479 --> 00:46:19,500
So there's no way for it to end without one of them

846
00:46:19,939 --> 00:46:20,649
dying.

847
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:25,790
Um It's not several people die, but you know, of the two of them, only one of them dies.

848
00:46:25,979 --> 00:46:27,209
And so I, but

849
00:46:28,169 --> 00:46:28,780
in so far as Hegel

850
00:46:28,949 --> 00:46:32,070
is always interested in the unity of unity and division.

851
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:38,419
What you get there is two people whose conflict with each other cancels

852
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:41,889
itself out and then what you get at the end the synthesis.

853
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,300
Although Hagel doesn't use that word

854
00:46:43,429 --> 00:46:46,340
is the survival of the Greek City state

855
00:46:46,659 --> 00:46:53,389
with increased knowledge of how those roles have to be treated within the Polish.

856
00:46:53,399 --> 00:46:56,889
So Creon ends the play essentially admitting that he

857
00:46:56,899 --> 00:47:00,219
shouldn't have had the attitude that he had to

858
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,090
his role.

859
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:01,989
So,

860
00:47:03,169 --> 00:47:08,419
so for Hagel, the reason that tragedy is art is because it shows this clash,

861
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:11,479
which ends in a kind of unification

862
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,679
comedy,

863
00:47:14,209 --> 00:47:18,010
also ancient comedy and Hagel's favorite is Aristophanes

864
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,639
also ends in reunification.

865
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,360
But it's because like if you take streps

866
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:29,419
sides as an example in the clouds, he doesn't take himself so seriously.

867
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:33,719
So he, you know, kind of goofs around and he undermines the city and then, you know,

868
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:35,060
he cheats and he,

869
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:42,050
and he's never like fixed on his role and that gives him an enormous amount of power.

870
00:47:42,169 --> 00:47:45,320
And so in the clouds, in particular, you also see the, like

871
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:48,409
the beginning of the erosion of the idea that the

872
00:47:48,419 --> 00:47:52,179
gods are really in control because they're being mocked in strips

873
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,310
and, and they had been before, this isn't new in Aristophanes necessarily.

874
00:47:56,479 --> 00:48:00,409
But at the end of that, you get a kind of cheerful reunification.

875
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:03,090
And Hegel actually says, um

876
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,570
at another point,

877
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:06,719
you know, maybe that's better,

878
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,090
you know, why would we choose the dark

879
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:18,229
and um desperate conflict of tragedy over the cheerful life affirming?

880
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:19,520
And I think there's a lot of this in Nietzsche

881
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:20,149
too,

882
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:25,629
life affirming laughter of someone who doesn't have to be so beholden to

883
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:29,610
his roles that he's willing to bring the whole society down around him.

884
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:33,350
So there's a, there's a, an extended story that I'm happy to tell if,

885
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,949
if you're interested um about how

886
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:36,989
that

887
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,739
changes in modern tragedy and modern comedy.

888
00:48:40,929 --> 00:48:43,469
Um But Hagel is pretty pessimistic about both

889
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:45,830
mo modern tragedy and modern comedy.

890
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:48,070
Um And essentially, I think,

891
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:52,000
thinks that we're going to have to transcend both of them or,

892
00:48:52,439 --> 00:48:56,719
and this is another big topic, move to more of a humor based aesthetic than a

893
00:48:57,149 --> 00:48:59,389
comedy based aesthetic,

894
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:00,919
right?

895
00:49:00,929 --> 00:49:05,629
Uh I'm going to ask you more about that, about modern comedy and tragedy in a second.

896
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:09,330
But I, I mean, I just wanted to make a brief comment because this was

897
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:13,860
to some extent, I mean, uh the, the way people like Hegel,

898
00:49:14,229 --> 00:49:15,439
Schopenhauer Nietzsche

899
00:49:15,629 --> 00:49:18,239
and others in the 19th century approached

900
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:23,020
uh aesthetics and art uh somewhat reminds me of

901
00:49:23,479 --> 00:49:27,139
uh how dismissive uh the

902
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:27,989
post

903
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,260
Socratic were of the Pres

904
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,360
Socratic

905
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:32,800
because the Pre

906
00:49:32,939 --> 00:49:38,280
Socratic took the poets and uh seriously when it comes to

907
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:38,620
uh

908
00:49:38,729 --> 00:49:43,929
I mean, perhaps uh also being able to acquire some sort of

909
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:48,459
knowledge through art, through fiction and all of that. And

910
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:50,459
I, and I, and I mean, of course, I,

911
00:49:50,469 --> 00:49:54,100
I don't think we can really be sure about what part

912
00:49:54,110 --> 00:49:58,770
of it came from Socrates or Plato because sometimes we don't know

913
00:49:58,919 --> 00:50:04,889
for sure if it's Socrates or Plato talking, but in Plato's works.

914
00:50:04,899 --> 00:50:06,979
But anyway, I, I mean,

915
00:50:07,084 --> 00:50:08,875
the Socrates

916
00:50:08,995 --> 00:50:09,854
and the,

917
00:50:09,864 --> 00:50:12,804
the other Greek philosophers who came after

918
00:50:12,814 --> 00:50:17,745
him were very dismissive of Homer specifically and

919
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:21,125
the other poets. And when you think about the Pres

920
00:50:21,304 --> 00:50:22,485
Socratic and even

921
00:50:22,735 --> 00:50:23,725
what we

922
00:50:23,945 --> 00:50:26,804
call the Sophists, I, I mean, nowadays,

923
00:50:26,814 --> 00:50:31,344
sophistry has a very negative connotation to it, but the Sophists

924
00:50:31,764 --> 00:50:35,495
were very much philosophers themselves, I think.

925
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:42,760
Uh so I, I wa I was just, I mean, it just came to my mind that uh there are,

926
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,719
there have been periods in

927
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:50,959
Western philosophy, where people have very much been dismissive of art,

928
00:50:51,064 --> 00:50:56,314
at least as a potential source of some kind of knowledge and

929
00:50:56,485 --> 00:51:00,254
others where people really engaged

930
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:06,324
with art seriously and philosophically took art seriously.

931
00:51:06,514 --> 00:51:07,574
Yeah. Absolutely.

932
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:10,554
Yeah. And I think this is the 19th century, is one

933
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:12,114
place where that pen direction.

934
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:19,050
So tell us about the issues that Hegel had with modern

935
00:51:19,219 --> 00:51:22,040
forms of art, particularly

936
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,360
uh with what we could call,

937
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:29,439
I guess modern subjectivity in art because uh

938
00:51:29,449 --> 00:51:32,719
as time went on and particularly since the,

939
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:36,310
I guess, more or less the 19th century onwards,

940
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,020
I mean, in literature and other forms of art,

941
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:44,129
we see people focusing more on

942
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:48,459
particular characters and character development and

943
00:51:48,469 --> 00:51:51,514
there's objectivity even what goes on

944
00:51:51,754 --> 00:51:55,834
in their minds through ex through lots and lots of,

945
00:51:55,965 --> 00:52:01,905
of, of texts sometimes just focusing on their inner thoughts and all of that.

946
00:52:01,915 --> 00:52:04,475
II, I guess that's what we could call a

947
00:52:04,675 --> 00:52:09,195
modern subjectivity in art to uh or perhaps

948
00:52:09,205 --> 00:52:12,125
there's also some other forms of subjectivity.

949
00:52:12,135 --> 00:52:14,145
But what did Hegel

950
00:52:14,354 --> 00:52:15,344
think about it?

951
00:52:16,189 --> 00:52:21,290
I think one of the best places to isolate that is in what he says about humor. And

952
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:23,209
yeah, and I think

953
00:52:23,979 --> 00:52:26,330
humor was a really new

954
00:52:26,669 --> 00:52:27,860
aesthetic phenomenon.

955
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:31,649
It essentially began with Lawrence Stern's Tristam Shandy,

956
00:52:31,939 --> 00:52:35,330
which was enormously popular in Germany. I mean,

957
00:52:35,439 --> 00:52:35,790
Goethe

958
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:36,560
and

959
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:40,879
Schiller and Lessing and anybody who was anybody

960
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:46,330
um loved Stern and his evocation of characters

961
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:51,739
who were not comic in the classic sense of like, Aristophanes.

962
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:52,639
Um,

963
00:52:52,729 --> 00:52:58,290
but were kind of quirky and had foibles and eccentricities

964
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,550
that made you kind of gently laugh at them.

965
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,399
So, not mock them, not

966
00:53:03,649 --> 00:53:04,820
guffaw

967
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:05,959
but,

968
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:11,840
but just recognize how much humans get obsessed

969
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:14,260
with what stern called their hobby horses.

970
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:15,149
Like their little

971
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,159
things that they're, the, the little things that they wanna be obsessed about.

972
00:53:19,169 --> 00:53:23,179
So, you know, whether it's your train set or his, you know, his uncle's military,

973
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,100
uh what

974
00:53:25,419 --> 00:53:26,969
was it? It wasn't exactly a

975
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:29,860
like models, I guess. Anyway, um

976
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:31,969
So Hagel thought

977
00:53:32,139 --> 00:53:35,560
that comedy and, and humor needed to be differentiated as,

978
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:37,540
as did um pretty much everybody in his

979
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,129
um generation.

980
00:53:39,189 --> 00:53:41,810
So comedy as a kind of dramatic art form

981
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:47,310
and humor as something that more suffused literature and poetry

982
00:53:47,479 --> 00:53:49,280
and that highlighted

983
00:53:49,419 --> 00:53:50,969
again this sense that

984
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:55,290
what is really important to pay attention to among humans now

985
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,219
is that since we've discovered as it were that

986
00:53:59,229 --> 00:54:01,669
we are the source of meaning in the world,

987
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:04,659
what is meaningful to us and how

988
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:09,409
kind of adorably silly that often is like how adorably silly

989
00:54:09,659 --> 00:54:12,139
many of our concerns are.

990
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:16,129
And I think Hegel thought that was really valuable aesthetically

991
00:54:17,149 --> 00:54:23,360
because it brought attention to, you know, the the concerns of art are no longer

992
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:28,649
the gods or big battles or even like sublime landscapes,

993
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:32,699
but like Dutch genre paintings or still lifes that

994
00:54:32,709 --> 00:54:38,409
show tiny little involved human obsessions with flowers or

995
00:54:38,739 --> 00:54:42,489
having your tooth pulled or, you know, like everyday human things,

996
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:47,620
but he did not like it when people became so subjective

997
00:54:47,919 --> 00:54:49,770
that they didn't try to

998
00:54:50,729 --> 00:54:55,129
extract any larger meaning from whatever it was that they were doing.

999
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:59,429
So he was very critical of Jean Paul Richter on this point,

1000
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,909
very critical of people like Schlegel,

1001
00:55:02,229 --> 00:55:02,550
Friedrich

1002
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:06,770
Schlegel. And you know, to a lesser extent, people like Novalis

1003
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:12,469
who Hagel thought were way too focused on their own interiority

1004
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:16,189
and stream of consciousness essentially as you were just describing

1005
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:17,840
and therefore, again,

1006
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:20,709
never made the connection back from

1007
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:24,409
subjectivity back into objectivity and therefore,

1008
00:55:24,419 --> 00:55:26,550
were not giving their

1009
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:32,169
audiences an experience of the truth. So that's always what's at stake for Hagel.

1010
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:35,550
Um So he's very critical of what he calls subjective humor

1011
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,790
and very admiring of what he calls objective humor.

1012
00:55:40,399 --> 00:55:45,100
Do you think that Hagel would have been a, a fan?

1013
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:49,739
Or at least like to some extent the existentialists,

1014
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,010
do you think that Hegel would have been a,

1015
00:55:55,020 --> 00:56:01,340
a fan or at least like to some extent the existentialists?

1016
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:08,530
I'm not so sure he would have been to be honest with you. I think he,

1017
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:11,149
he, as I said earlier,

1018
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:16,350
he was really interested in making a society function on an institutional level.

1019
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:18,530
So what kind of form of government do we need?

1020
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:22,070
What kind of um social order, what kind of economic order,

1021
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,699
what kind of family situation

1022
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,360
and in so far as existentialists and this is generalizing but

1023
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:30,350
often

1024
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:36,050
emphasize the subject in opposition to those things.

1025
00:56:36,219 --> 00:56:37,840
I think Hagel would have

1026
00:56:38,139 --> 00:56:41,370
again, felt like, well, but what we're after here is truth,

1027
00:56:41,379 --> 00:56:44,530
which is the unity of unity and division, not just division.

1028
00:56:44,899 --> 00:56:49,929
And we have a world to run like it's our responsibility to run this world.

1029
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,979
There's no God out there to help us out,

1030
00:56:51,989 --> 00:56:54,489
there's no natural order like we've got to get this right.

1031
00:56:54,939 --> 00:56:58,729
And if there's, and again, this is to caricature. But

1032
00:56:59,270 --> 00:57:06,489
if existentialists are sometimes seen as self obsessed or just as oppositional to

1033
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,620
the order,

1034
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:11,750
I think Hagel would have been much more interested in reforming the order in

1035
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:16,179
ways that would better allow humans to be free and the way he thought

1036
00:57:16,379 --> 00:57:19,919
humans needed to be free. And that back to something we were saying a minute ago,

1037
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:24,699
I think this is something that Marx picks up from. Hagel is very much about

1038
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:29,850
what kind of material conditions do humans need in order to be free.

1039
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:31,250
So it's not enough

1040
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,949
to say as Kant did um that you're free if you're self determining

1041
00:57:35,959 --> 00:57:37,590
and can act against your inclinations

1042
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,570
in accordance with the categorical imperative.

1043
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:43,129
I realize that Kant scholars are going to say that that's not all he meant.

1044
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:46,070
And, and I accept that, but Hagel was much more explicit

1045
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:49,939
in trying to say what real freedom means is paying

1046
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:54,020
attention to what people need in institutions around them.

1047
00:57:54,399 --> 00:57:55,139
And

1048
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:59,699
you know, just life forms around them in order to be, to flourish as

1049
00:57:59,899 --> 00:58:01,929
humans with dignity and respect.

1050
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:04,939
So again, that's maybe too hard on the existentialist.

1051
00:58:04,949 --> 00:58:08,439
But I, I think that might be his general take.

1052
00:58:09,439 --> 00:58:12,139
That's very interesting because o of course,

1053
00:58:12,149 --> 00:58:15,169
we know that Marx was influenced by Hegel

1054
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:16,679
to some extent,

1055
00:58:16,899 --> 00:58:21,979
but sometimes because people have these simplistic views of

1056
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:25,939
Hegel and Marx they think, oh, how could it be?

1057
00:58:25,949 --> 00:58:31,469
Because Hegel was supposedly a big idealist and Marx was a me

1058
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:35,030
realist. I mean, how could they be more opposite?

1059
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,129
But uh I mean,

1060
00:58:36,139 --> 00:58:39,209
what you mentioned there and uh Hegel caring

1061
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:42,560
very much about how we structure society,

1062
00:58:42,570 --> 00:58:43,169
about

1063
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:48,439
the institutions we create and how we create them based on

1064
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:49,270
what

1065
00:58:49,479 --> 00:58:50,909
values, I guess.

1066
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,030
Uh I mean, it's very much uh

1067
00:58:54,679 --> 00:59:00,280
I guess also applied philosophy or political philosophy

1068
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:04,100
as some of what Marx also cared about.

1069
00:59:04,439 --> 00:59:05,790
Absolutely. And I,

1070
00:59:05,979 --> 00:59:06,239
you know,

1071
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:11,540
I think another thing that you can find in Hegel that I think is just much more

1072
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:15,489
clearly articulated in Marx is that freedom can be a kind of

1073
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,750
ideological lie

1074
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:18,870
if

1075
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,360
you continue to tell people that they're free as a

1076
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:26,350
way of distracting them from the fact that they're being exploited

1077
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:30,310
and alienated, right? So if you make people focus on,

1078
00:59:30,689 --> 00:59:31,030
yes,

1079
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,370
but I'm a free and determining being

1080
00:59:32,379 --> 00:59:34,320
because I can follow the categorical imperative,

1081
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:36,750
which I, I again, that's a caricature.

1082
00:59:37,489 --> 00:59:40,560
Um Then people are going to feel like, well, you know,

1083
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:45,070
who cares what sort of deprived economic situation I live in.

1084
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:47,949
I'm still free and Hagel, I think, worried

1085
00:59:48,129 --> 00:59:48,510
that

1086
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:49,879
that kind, that,

1087
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:53,330
that kind of idea could fall into the wrong

1088
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:56,419
hands of people who knew how to manipulate it.

1089
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:57,649
Such that

1090
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:01,629
exactly as you said, you know, you can be a, a worker who's being totally exploited.

1091
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:06,419
But as long as you're told that there's a kind of freedom that exists

1092
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:11,419
in transcending that or not caring about it or, or that actually,

1093
01:00:11,429 --> 01:00:13,090
you know what it is to be human is to,

1094
01:00:13,959 --> 01:00:17,860
to subsist despite the struggle of economic depravity,

1095
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,139
I think Hagel also would say that's just,

1096
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,560
that's manipulative, it's deceitful and it's unethical.

1097
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:28,979
Uh it's, it's, it is not, it is false freedom, it is empty, fake, false freedom.

1098
01:00:29,189 --> 01:00:32,790
And it can be a kind of uh a tool in the hands of people

1099
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,409
who want to manipulate others into ignoring

1100
01:00:35,419 --> 01:00:36,939
the ways in which they're being exploited,

1101
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:41,510
which is very interesting because I guess that this is also another

1102
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,429
idea that people do not tend at all to associate with Hegel.

1103
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:49,909
But as Marx, he also cared about

1104
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,510
the poverty, right?

1105
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:54,830
And about the causes of poverty and the

1106
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:58,429
potential effects it would have on people's behavior.

1107
01:00:58,439 --> 01:00:58,929
Correct.

1108
01:00:59,500 --> 01:00:59,709
Yeah.

1109
01:00:59,719 --> 01:01:01,949
So this is specifically in the passages where

1110
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:04,090
he talks about what's called the rabble.

1111
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:08,419
And, and I think this is again, a distinction that Marx picks up on

1112
01:01:09,149 --> 01:01:14,639
that what Hagel means by the rabble is not just people who are impoverished. So

1113
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:18,699
and Hagel, like many people thinks that there will always be

1114
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,979
poverty.

1115
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,100
But what's new

1116
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:24,389
since, you know,

1117
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:28,389
well, not new now, but new since the modern world essentially

1118
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:34,489
is the claim that all humans are worthy of dignity and respect

1119
01:01:34,939 --> 01:01:40,729
and the acknowledgement or just the fact that our economies are human

1120
01:01:40,959 --> 01:01:42,010
creations.

1121
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:47,060
So whereas poverty before could be explained just by natural phenomenon

1122
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:50,209
or just by a hierarchy that we were told was natural.

1123
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:52,610
You know, the king gets to be rich and you have to be poor

1124
01:01:52,939 --> 01:01:56,719
because God made him the king and made you a pauper.

1125
01:01:57,469 --> 01:02:01,979
Now, the combination of the claim that all humans are worthy of dignity and respect

1126
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:04,830
and a human created economy,

1127
01:02:04,969 --> 01:02:09,020
that means that many people live in total depravity

1128
01:02:09,219 --> 01:02:11,229
generates a kind of

1129
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,600
rage on the part of

1130
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:18,090
what Hagel then calls the rabble. Um that is entirely justified

1131
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:20,399
and that Hagel sees as a pretty existential

1132
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:23,780
threat to modern society because they're right,

1133
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,189
right. It's, it's not that we need them

1134
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,699
to get over this fact that they're right about it.

1135
01:02:28,939 --> 01:02:32,060
And as long as that's true, they,

1136
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:36,919
you know, society will be unstable because they will correctly demand

1137
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,639
the material conditions.

1138
01:02:38,649 --> 01:02:43,439
For the thing that they're told is their kind of existential, right.

1139
01:02:43,959 --> 01:02:48,780
So in HGL talks about ways to solve that through essentially what

1140
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:55,050
we would call labor unions or other forms within civil society that would

1141
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:57,040
and within the government

1142
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:00,250
that would represent not just geographical

1143
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:03,159
interests but economic interests.

1144
01:03:03,189 --> 01:03:06,870
So when, when you look at what Hagel says about the form the state should take,

1145
01:03:06,879 --> 01:03:09,110
I think one of the most overlooked facts

1146
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:14,030
is that he does not want purely geographical representation.

1147
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:15,350
He doesn't want, you know,

1148
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,389
Prussia gets two delegates and Bavaria gets two delegates and no

1149
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,030
following is two delegates but

1150
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,989
that different classes and different

1151
01:03:23,110 --> 01:03:24,790
kinds of um

1152
01:03:25,479 --> 01:03:27,979
of industry get representation.

1153
01:03:27,989 --> 01:03:30,969
So that to me is very clear evidence that he

1154
01:03:30,989 --> 01:03:35,899
was worried about not just the material conditions of capitalism,

1155
01:03:35,909 --> 01:03:39,870
but also the questions of identity and self-respect

1156
01:03:40,070 --> 01:03:43,020
that are necessary in the modern work world

1157
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:46,810
um that are essentially trampled on by capitalism.

1158
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:53,969
And so um could we say that Hegel like Marx was also

1159
01:03:54,149 --> 01:03:58,969
or thought that it was a moral imperative for society to try

1160
01:03:58,979 --> 01:04:05,370
as best as we could to alleviate or ideally eradicate poverty?

1161
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,629
Yeah, absolutely. I I don't think Hale

1162
01:04:07,739 --> 01:04:10,330
thought it could be completely eradicated. But

1163
01:04:10,659 --> 01:04:11,560
um yeah,

1164
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:14,080
I there's no question in my mind that he saw

1165
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:18,149
this as the deepest and most insidious kind of hypocrisy

1166
01:04:18,370 --> 01:04:23,560
that a society would say on the one hand that everyone is equal and

1167
01:04:23,969 --> 01:04:28,010
deserving of dignity and respect and then continue

1168
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,879
to choose

1169
01:04:30,169 --> 01:04:32,919
um an an economic system

1170
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:38,350
that made that a joke, right? And it's very bad joke, a sad joke.

1171
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:40,840
Um It made it laughable in the worst possible way.

1172
01:04:41,149 --> 01:04:42,590
And that a society that

1173
01:04:43,469 --> 01:04:46,649
continues down that road is both

1174
01:04:46,879 --> 01:04:47,800
morally

1175
01:04:48,459 --> 01:04:51,899
responsible and in danger of instability.

1176
01:04:51,909 --> 01:04:54,439
So I do, I do think Hagel thinks those two things are separate.

1177
01:04:54,550 --> 01:04:58,879
So a better functioning society is going to be 11 with less inequality.

1178
01:04:58,889 --> 01:05:04,600
But also that totally aside, just as a moral issue. Um yeah, this is a classic failure

1179
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,800
and just to be totally clear because at a certain point there,

1180
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:12,919
you mentioned the fact that some of these ideas stem from

1181
01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:15,399
the more general idea that

1182
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:21,110
people, individual, people themselves have intrinsic value.

1183
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,489
I mean, this is not just a matter of

1184
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:26,969
caring about alleviating poverty with the

1185
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:32,649
long term success of a particular society in mind, but also caring

1186
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:37,989
actually about the individuals themselves and the conditions

1187
01:05:38,169 --> 01:05:38,929
they live in.

1188
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,489
Yes and their emotional and

1189
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:47,070
effective attachment to their value as workers.

1190
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:51,389
So when he starts to talk about solutions to this kind of poverty, he says,

1191
01:05:51,550 --> 01:05:51,729
you know,

1192
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:57,500
you can certainly get government agencies involved in essentially welfare,

1193
01:05:57,959 --> 01:06:01,010
but that's not going to fix the problem of self-respect.

1194
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:03,159
You have to give people

1195
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:07,379
the possibility of having dignity in their work if work is going

1196
01:06:07,389 --> 01:06:12,060
to be such a central part of existence in a capitalist system.

1197
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,419
Um And so yeah, ju I mean,

1198
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,879
just trying to eradicate it through philanthropy is

1199
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,300
also not going to fix the problem.

1200
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:25,510
It has to come at the level of actually valuing workers in their roles as workers.

1201
01:06:26,429 --> 01:06:30,590
Oh my God. So it was not just that Marx was an

1202
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,620
alien but Hagel was also a Marxist.

1203
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:36,209
Well, not everybody would agree with me.

1204
01:06:36,219 --> 01:06:39,250
But, but, yeah, I mean, I, I think that's all, that's all very clear to me.

1205
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:42,449
Um, that, that is part of what Hagel was concerned about and, you know,

1206
01:06:42,459 --> 01:06:47,870
there are places in his philosophy where he is also guilty of that kind of hypocrisy.

1207
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:50,770
So it's not as if he had some sort of moral

1208
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:53,850
genius that allowed him to see that in other parts of his

1209
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:54,620
life.

1210
01:06:54,629 --> 01:06:54,820
But I,

1211
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:58,020
I think that was one place where he really did see

1212
01:06:58,030 --> 01:07:00,979
the dangers that we are living with very presently now.

1213
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:06,260
Yeah. No, but I mean, I, I made, I made that sort of a joke but,

1214
01:07:06,479 --> 01:07:11,669
uh, uh, I, if, uh, he's, if you didn't mention his name,

1215
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:15,800
just everything you said about poverty and capitalism that

1216
01:07:15,810 --> 01:07:18,340
we should structure society and all of that,

1217
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:19,790
I mean,

1218
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,399
if someone told me it was Marx to,

1219
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:24,360
I

1220
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,290
won't believe it.

1221
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:26,419
Yeah. Yeah.

1222
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:27,189
Yeah.

1223
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:27,449
Yeah.

1224
01:07:27,459 --> 01:07:31,649
I think that's true and that would be true until we started talking about the state.

1225
01:07:31,659 --> 01:07:31,969
Right.

1226
01:07:31,979 --> 01:07:35,560
So Hagel talks about all of this when he's talking about civil society,

1227
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:36,949
which is the middle one of the.

1228
01:07:36,959 --> 01:07:39,590
So he talks about the family and civil society and the state

1229
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:40,320
and its,

1230
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:42,689
when he starts to talk about the state that you

1231
01:07:42,699 --> 01:07:44,800
would no longer think we were talking about Marx.

1232
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:46,850
Great.

1233
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:50,919
So, uh we've already talked here a little bit about uh comedy,

1234
01:07:50,929 --> 01:07:57,449
but one of the things you've also done work on, uh and again, focusing on

1235
01:07:57,629 --> 01:08:01,489
uh 19th century German philosophy is how

1236
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:05,669
seriously some of these philosophers took laughter.

1237
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:06,510
Right.

1238
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:07,870
Yeah.

1239
01:08:07,879 --> 01:08:11,699
Or we might say like the laughable because it,

1240
01:08:11,709 --> 01:08:16,609
it's so hard to put all of the things that we laugh at under uh and,

1241
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:19,509
and a lot of things that are laughable, we don't actually laugh at.

1242
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,180
So it's, it's a very thorny um

1243
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:27,950
topic. But, but yes, especially around the time when Hagel was writing.

1244
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:29,549
Um again, people like

1245
01:08:29,799 --> 01:08:30,520
Schlegel,

1246
01:08:30,629 --> 01:08:34,569
um and some of the other more romantic philosophers like Zolar

1247
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,620
um were taking this question of what we laugh at and why or,

1248
01:08:39,629 --> 01:08:42,569
or what it means to differentiate between wit

1249
01:08:42,729 --> 01:08:46,870
and irony and humor really seriously.

1250
01:08:47,009 --> 01:08:51,160
And I think that, uh you know, Lessing was another one who took this very seriously.

1251
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:51,899
Um

1252
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:57,140
Eta Hoffman, like the whole constellation of people who were philosophical,

1253
01:08:57,149 --> 01:08:59,459
but also writing in literature.

1254
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:00,419
Um

1255
01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:03,319
And I think again, it comes back to this question, like,

1256
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:06,080
what does it say about humans that we laugh?

1257
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:09,279
And what does it say about us that we find

1258
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:12,339
this whole range of things either funny or laughable?

1259
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:16,339
And what could we determine about the essence of what it is to be human

1260
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:18,919
by really trying to figure that out?

1261
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,279
And if you're someone like

1262
01:09:20,839 --> 01:09:21,169
Schlegel

1263
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:25,160
who thinks that Hegel is wrong

1264
01:09:25,479 --> 01:09:29,959
to imagine that we can articulate truth in philosophy,

1265
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:36,140
then you're going to be looking towards other forms that maybe as

1266
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:39,379
Schlegel would sort of put it gesture at the truth

1267
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,060
while not articulating it.

1268
01:09:42,149 --> 01:09:44,689
Because articulating it is always going to

1269
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:48,620
introduce new categories and therefore new division.

1270
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:51,100
So if the true is the whole, I think Schlegel

1271
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:52,879
would say to Hegel,

1272
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:53,609
um

1273
01:09:54,919 --> 01:09:59,259
any conceptualization is just going to show the division again.

1274
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:02,839
And if you want something that retains the unity,

1275
01:10:03,069 --> 01:10:06,580
it has to remain at the level of affect or

1276
01:10:07,529 --> 01:10:08,540
something like

1277
01:10:08,779 --> 01:10:09,729
irony,

1278
01:10:09,879 --> 01:10:14,990
which doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't define things,

1279
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,189
but sort of says that things are true through saying they're opposite

1280
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:23,939
or says something that's witty in a way that

1281
01:10:24,089 --> 01:10:27,390
you don't take literally, but you see the truth behind it.

1282
01:10:27,629 --> 01:10:31,439
Um So all of these are ways in which a whole range of people

1283
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,229
in the romantic generation

1284
01:10:33,549 --> 01:10:38,470
decided that if we could understand that and the way that functions in the way humans

1285
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,660
interact with each other and lead our aesthetic lives,

1286
01:10:41,669 --> 01:10:43,379
then we could probably understand something

1287
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:46,229
much deeper about humans themselves and about

1288
01:10:46,379 --> 01:10:47,819
metaphysics quite honestly.

1289
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:52,029
Um So there's a lot of um I edited a volume of essays about

1290
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:56,020
uh humor in the 19th century. And as I say in the introduction,

1291
01:10:56,180 --> 01:10:59,419
usually when I tell people that they laugh because

1292
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:02,299
um one of the things we laugh at is incongruity

1293
01:11:02,729 --> 01:11:06,140
and it feels so incongruous to talk about

1294
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:09,350
humor in this generation of very serious philosophers,

1295
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:11,350
but it is something they took really seriously.

1296
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:13,250
And I mean,

1297
01:11:13,259 --> 01:11:18,370
trying to understand something about our human nature through laughter.

1298
01:11:18,379 --> 01:11:22,399
I mean, there are many different ways we can try to understand it. Right.

1299
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:24,700
And I mean, even philosophers themselves,

1300
01:11:24,709 --> 01:11:27,979
many different philosophers across history

1301
01:11:28,089 --> 01:11:28,600
uh

1302
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:33,100
have had different theories about why people laugh

1303
01:11:33,299 --> 01:11:34,529
at something. And,

1304
01:11:34,799 --> 01:11:37,180
uh, I, I mean, perhaps all of them are true.

1305
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:38,580
I don't know because some,

1306
01:11:38,589 --> 01:11:44,520
we laugh at different things in different contexts for different reasons.

1307
01:11:44,529 --> 01:11:44,779
I mean,

1308
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:48,000
sometimes we might laugh at something because it's

1309
01:11:48,009 --> 01:11:51,660
funny and why it's funny is an entire

1310
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:53,810
question by itself. But

1311
01:11:54,069 --> 01:11:59,009
uh sometimes perhaps people laugh at someone to mock them.

1312
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:02,750
Not exactly because it's funny, but just to mock them or

1313
01:12:02,879 --> 01:12:07,250
to feel superior to other people, perhaps something,

1314
01:12:07,379 --> 01:12:09,450
someone does something wrong.

1315
01:12:09,470 --> 01:12:11,250
Uh And they are, I mean,

1316
01:12:11,259 --> 01:12:15,359
competing with them and then the other person laughs just because, oh,

1317
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:16,589
you made the mistake.

1318
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:21,410
So I'm in a, in a better situation than you are or something like that. So,

1319
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,060
I mean, the, uh just thinking about laughter itself and

1320
01:12:26,529 --> 01:12:33,549
the many different contexts and reasons why people laugh is, uh,

1321
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:35,549
I mean, it's, it's a very

1322
01:12:36,089 --> 01:12:37,270
wide

1323
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,680
uh field of inquiry, I guess.

1324
01:12:41,049 --> 01:12:42,080
Yeah, absolutely.

1325
01:12:42,759 --> 01:12:43,169
Yeah.

1326
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:48,080
OK. So, um let's get now into uh

1327
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,830
how you got interested

1328
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,279
in abolitionism

1329
01:12:53,390 --> 01:12:58,509
in America in the 19th century. So, tell us first about that.

1330
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,950
What got you interested in that and then

1331
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:05,180
we'll get into the work of Lydia Maria Child.

1332
01:13:05,709 --> 01:13:06,189
Yeah,

1333
01:13:07,089 --> 01:13:10,229
this was, um, a very direct

1334
01:13:11,169 --> 01:13:15,390
response on my part to the 2016 election in the United States.

1335
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:17,270
So when, when Donald Trump was elected,

1336
01:13:17,609 --> 01:13:20,310
um it became very clear to many of us that

1337
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:23,629
we were in a kind of moral and political emergency.

1338
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:27,990
Uh So the real resurgence of a kind of far right,

1339
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,629
political stance and all of the other things that Trump represented,

1340
01:13:32,979 --> 01:13:39,029
including his um just open derision of and abuse of women.

1341
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:40,520
And

1342
01:13:40,810 --> 01:13:43,220
I think as a Hagel scholar,

1343
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,799
I've always had to grapple a little bit with

1344
01:13:47,009 --> 01:13:51,799
what, how I felt when I would read Hagel scholarship from

1345
01:13:51,959 --> 01:13:53,729
the 19 thirties.

1346
01:13:53,979 --> 01:13:55,459
And I would always

1347
01:13:55,959 --> 01:13:57,640
have in the back of my mind,

1348
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,089
what did this person think they were doing?

1349
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:06,339
Um was what they were doing more important than anything they could have been doing

1350
01:14:06,540 --> 01:14:09,500
to fight the rise of fascism in Germany.

1351
01:14:09,759 --> 01:14:13,459
Um And I don't pretend I don't mean to be judgmental.

1352
01:14:13,470 --> 01:14:16,100
I'm sure people have all kinds of reasons, et cetera, but

1353
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:19,790
I just had a very clear sense very quickly that I

1354
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:23,149
needed my professional life and my scholarship to

1355
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,910
reflect the time that I was living in.

1356
01:14:26,209 --> 01:14:27,700
And I had a,

1357
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:32,979
I wanted to know who in my own country and in my own history.

1358
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:39,459
Um I could turn to as an example of someone who had faced a moral emergency in

1359
01:14:39,629 --> 01:14:40,620
their country.

1360
01:14:41,149 --> 01:14:45,850
Head on. And I just decided I wanted to turn to women. I'd spent 20 years of my career

1361
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:50,299
really exclusively focusing on men. And so I, I asked myself

1362
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:56,970
to fight something as entrenched as enslavement was in the United States

1363
01:14:57,319 --> 01:14:58,490
in the 19th century.

1364
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:02,410
I just thought you'd have to be thinking philosophically,

1365
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:05,729
you'd have to be asking big questions like,

1366
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:11,009
what is equality, what is justice? What does it mean to be a human?

1367
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,970
What is moral obligation? Um

1368
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:18,419
So I went to an archive associated with Harvard and

1369
01:15:18,839 --> 01:15:22,299
that, that is a, a library and an archive specifically about women and

1370
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:24,930
asked if they knew of any

1371
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:27,450
women with a kind of philosophical

1372
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:32,850
uh trajectory who had been involved in abolitionism and they didn't.

1373
01:15:33,109 --> 01:15:36,759
But they gave me a box of letters that included

1374
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:39,859
a letter by this woman who I'd never heard of,

1375
01:15:40,189 --> 01:15:44,620
but um was immediately just transfixed by her moral vision,

1376
01:15:45,229 --> 01:15:48,339
her ability to argue philosophically

1377
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:53,100
um and her ability to dedicate her life to

1378
01:15:53,509 --> 01:15:54,299
ending

1379
01:15:54,569 --> 01:15:56,859
entrenched evil in her country. So

1380
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:01,029
I decided to pivot towards doing something about her.

1381
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,879
And at first I, I did write a couple of more academic articles about her.

1382
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:09,649
She was definitely a philosophical thinker. She also talked about philosophy.

1383
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:13,950
She read philosophy, she was very influenced by German philosophy.

1384
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:17,399
Um She regularly cites Schiller and Goethe

1385
01:16:17,799 --> 01:16:18,209
and Harrier

1386
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,870
and John Paul. She mentions Kant,

1387
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,299
she mentions Hegel.

1388
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:26,109
German philosophy was very popular in the United States. Um,

1389
01:16:26,259 --> 01:16:28,810
in the 18 thirties and forties when she started writing.

1390
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:35,259
So I had a lot of pretty instant connections to her philosophical thinking.

1391
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:37,609
But what really again

1392
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:41,109
got my attention was she wrote a book in 18 33

1393
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,649
and that's almost three decades before the American Civil War started.

1394
01:16:45,330 --> 01:16:47,910
So in 18 33 he wrote a book called

1395
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:53,859
An Appeal in Favor of that class of Americans called Africans.

1396
01:16:54,439 --> 01:17:01,060
And this, this is just a fire hose of arguments denouncing

1397
01:17:01,339 --> 01:17:05,350
all of the bad arguments that Americans had been using

1398
01:17:05,850 --> 01:17:07,729
to justify slavery.

1399
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:10,950
And I was so impressed by how she,

1400
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:13,509
I think her general philosophical commitment was

1401
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:16,069
to thinking that humans are basically good,

1402
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:21,839
but they're susceptible to bad arguments that appeal to their selfishness,

1403
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:23,779
their self interest, their vanity.

1404
01:17:24,279 --> 01:17:27,450
And if you can just clear away those arguments,

1405
01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:29,020
you can really

1406
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:32,910
get them to reform. I'm not sure she was right about that.

1407
01:17:33,310 --> 01:17:37,089
I don't even think she thought she was right about that by the end of her life.

1408
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:42,810
Um But I became really fascinated both by her as a philosophical thinker,

1409
01:17:43,339 --> 01:17:46,839
but also as a woman whose life intersects in

1410
01:17:47,149 --> 01:17:51,459
all of the major moments leading up to and through the American

1411
01:17:51,609 --> 01:17:52,770
Civil War.

1412
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:53,560
Um

1413
01:17:54,009 --> 01:17:59,439
She did everything from put her body between abolitionist speakers and anti

1414
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:01,359
abolitionist mobs.

1415
01:18:01,464 --> 01:18:05,254
She wrote fiction and also argumentative essays.

1416
01:18:05,265 --> 01:18:08,154
She wrote biographies, she wrote histories.

1417
01:18:08,185 --> 01:18:12,495
Um She volunteered herself raising money for and sewing for

1418
01:18:12,685 --> 01:18:15,245
both union soldiers and,

1419
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:18,544
um, enslaved peoples. So she, um,

1420
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:19,524
she was,

1421
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:20,740
she is,

1422
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:26,729
to me a real example of someone who took her role as an American citizen seriously

1423
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:29,819
and deployed everything she could think of,

1424
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:35,299
uh, to address what she saw as the great moral crisis in her country.

1425
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:37,580
So I wrote a biography of her. Um,

1426
01:18:38,069 --> 01:18:41,899
again, I, I thought I would just sort of write academic articles about her, but

1427
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:45,459
the story is so compelling that I ended up writing the

1428
01:18:45,470 --> 01:18:48,339
whole thing and that came out um about six months ago.

1429
01:18:49,399 --> 01:18:52,810
Great. Uh And II, I mean, uh

1430
01:18:53,060 --> 01:18:57,100
we also have to keep in mind that the 19th century

1431
01:18:57,310 --> 01:18:58,410
was not

1432
01:18:58,729 --> 01:19:00,959
to, to put it mildly

1433
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:08,990
very women friendly and also for the most part, not very friendly to

1434
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:13,129
any person who was not of European descent,

1435
01:19:13,419 --> 01:19:19,720
basically in, in terms of the mainstream philosophers, thinkers,

1436
01:19:19,729 --> 01:19:21,009
scientists and so on.

1437
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:27,109
Uh I mean, of course, we have to keep also in mind the cultural context back then.

1438
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:27,790
And I,

1439
01:19:27,939 --> 01:19:30,509
I'm also not one of those people who,

1440
01:19:30,609 --> 01:19:35,580
of course, I say that that they were wrong in terms of their sexism and racism.

1441
01:19:35,589 --> 01:19:36,959
But I don't think that

1442
01:19:37,290 --> 01:19:40,390
if I lived back then I wouldn't

1443
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:43,759
have been racist and sexist myself, of course,

1444
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:48,120
very likely I would have been one as well and

1445
01:19:48,259 --> 01:19:50,209
most of us, I guess so.

1446
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:55,640
Uh But I mean, we have to keep that, keep that in mind but also

1447
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:59,600
the struggle that women and, uh,

1448
01:19:59,919 --> 01:20:00,419
but,

1449
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:06,689
uh African Americans and other minorities went through and particularly since

1450
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:10,649
we are approaching things here from a philosophical perspective

1451
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:13,819
and I am talking with U as an academic,

1452
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:14,970
I mean,

1453
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:20,680
it's historically, it's a fact and even con temporarily that,

1454
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:21,529
uh,

1455
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:25,709
women and, uh, other minorities,

1456
01:20:25,819 --> 01:20:33,580
uh, I mean, their work has very much been neglected, sometimes suppressed and,

1457
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:39,279
uh, stuff like that. Right. So, it's, it's not been easy at all for

1458
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:41,319
people who are not

1459
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,149
European white

1460
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:47,430
males and European white males,

1461
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:52,069
particularly from the upper classes to have their voices heard.

1462
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:52,790
Yeah.

1463
01:20:53,339 --> 01:20:58,330
Yeah. And, and there's really wonderful work being done on that. So, um Kristen Yah

1464
01:20:58,779 --> 01:20:59,000
and Dal

1465
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:03,029
and Nassar just last year published a whole anthology of

1466
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,750
work by women philosophers in Germany in the 19th century.

1467
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:10,020
And Alison Stone and I are working on a handbook

1468
01:21:10,029 --> 01:21:13,740
about British and American women philosophers in the 19th century.

1469
01:21:14,089 --> 01:21:17,899
There were many more of them than we think there were.

1470
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:22,259
And they were often much better known than we think they were.

1471
01:21:22,549 --> 01:21:25,879
So, what we're talking about is a combination of, of course,

1472
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:29,180
women didn't have the same opportunities as men as far as education

1473
01:21:29,450 --> 01:21:30,040
goes.

1474
01:21:30,049 --> 01:21:30,620
But they,

1475
01:21:30,629 --> 01:21:36,839
but even those who manage to philosophize despite that were pretty actively

1476
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:42,200
repressed and forgotten later, like not in their lifetimes but later. So,

1477
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:44,700
so there's a lot of really interesting work on that. Um

1478
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:47,700
that I I feel very passionate about.

1479
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:49,609
And I, I also think to your other point,

1480
01:21:49,620 --> 01:21:54,100
it's really important for us to acknowledge in as much

1481
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:56,410
detail as we can

1482
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,220
the damage that people like Hagel did on these topics.

1483
01:22:00,229 --> 01:22:02,660
So I think even myself as a woman,

1484
01:22:02,919 --> 01:22:04,799
I used to just sort of think, well, of course,

1485
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:08,020
he thought women were like plants like everybody did,

1486
01:22:08,470 --> 01:22:09,620
but that's not true.

1487
01:22:09,629 --> 01:22:13,339
There were lots of people including women who didn't think that, but there were,

1488
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:19,040
he did have options available to him and even more so on race.

1489
01:22:19,049 --> 01:22:23,609
So there's a, there's really important work by Daniel James and Franz

1490
01:22:23,970 --> 01:22:24,450
Kopek

1491
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:25,790
and um

1492
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:26,720
and,

1493
01:22:26,729 --> 01:22:32,229
and others on what Hagel probably did know about other ways of thinking about non

1494
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:36,709
European peoples which he deliberately chose to ignore or suppress.

1495
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:40,270
And there's even terrible stories about Hagel.

1496
01:22:40,439 --> 01:22:45,240
Hagel's like philosophy of history being used as a justification

1497
01:22:45,589 --> 01:22:48,839
in the United States for perpetuating slavery.

1498
01:22:49,479 --> 01:22:54,689
And, you know, I was talking earlier about Hagel's ability to pinpoint hypocrisies

1499
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:57,450
um between in a culture that said on the one hand,

1500
01:22:57,459 --> 01:22:59,959
all humans are worthy of dignity and respect.

1501
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:02,200
And on the other hand, subjecting them to

1502
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:08,839
capitalism's woes. Obviously, Hagel himself is horrendously guilty of doing that

1503
01:23:09,879 --> 01:23:15,419
pretty much with anyone who wasn't, as you said, an upper class white European male.

1504
01:23:15,560 --> 01:23:20,660
Um And I have become much less willing just to say, wow, OK,

1505
01:23:20,669 --> 01:23:23,020
that's like a part of his philosophy, we can ignore

1506
01:23:23,330 --> 01:23:26,410
um and much more determined to take that head on

1507
01:23:26,799 --> 01:23:31,979
and, and as you say, too importantly, augmented with a kind of humility

1508
01:23:32,410 --> 01:23:33,220
that

1509
01:23:33,529 --> 01:23:35,470
reminds myself as well,

1510
01:23:35,479 --> 01:23:38,919
that I'm probably on the wrong side of history on other things.

1511
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:39,959
And that, um

1512
01:23:40,439 --> 01:23:42,129
if I were living at Hegel's time,

1513
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:45,319
I probably would have had many opinions that were not very enlightened

1514
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:46,330
either.

1515
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:47,959
So, to me, that's part of the,

1516
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:50,490
the general project of thinking about the 19th

1517
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:53,810
century is elevating voices like childs that are

1518
01:23:54,120 --> 01:23:54,830
um

1519
01:23:55,339 --> 01:23:59,609
so philosophical and so resonant and using the same kinds of ideas,

1520
01:23:59,620 --> 01:24:01,120
including ideas about art

1521
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:03,279
that Hagel was interested in,

1522
01:24:03,509 --> 01:24:05,899
but really in the service of good

1523
01:24:06,229 --> 01:24:10,120
and trying to be much more mindful and critical of ways in which

1524
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:15,850
Hegel's philosophy is beautiful and compelling as it can be um was used for evil.

1525
01:24:16,799 --> 01:24:17,229
Yeah.

1526
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:17,479
Uh

1527
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:18,259
I mean,

1528
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:21,399
this is another entire discussion that I think

1529
01:24:21,410 --> 01:24:23,459
is very interesting that people can have.

1530
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:26,390
I mean, uh and the same applies to artists.

1531
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:26,689
I mean,

1532
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:33,279
sometimes people discuss if what we should do with the work of immoral artists,

1533
01:24:33,290 --> 01:24:38,424
if we should ban it, if not, if we, if we don't ban it,

1534
01:24:38,654 --> 01:24:40,734
uh we should analyze it.

1535
01:24:40,745 --> 01:24:43,895
Uh We should think of it if we should appreciate

1536
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:47,515
it or not and if we should criticize it,

1537
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:51,424
uh I mean, there's uh an immensity of questions out there

1538
01:24:51,689 --> 01:24:53,560
that are very interesting about that.

1539
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:56,950
But, but uh uh I mean, of course, Uh

1540
01:24:57,149 --> 01:25:01,009
I'm not myself and I don't think you are some of those people.

1541
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:04,140
I think that perhaps we should be because

1542
01:25:04,149 --> 01:25:07,515
someone in the 19th century or the 18th century

1543
01:25:07,524 --> 01:25:12,404
had some appalling views on women and uh black

1544
01:25:12,415 --> 01:25:15,575
people and other minorities that we should just,

1545
01:25:15,854 --> 01:25:16,575
uh,

1546
01:25:17,035 --> 01:25:17,044
I

1547
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:22,165
completely ignore or think that the rest of their work is,

1548
01:25:22,384 --> 01:25:23,555
doesn't have any

1549
01:25:23,895 --> 01:25:25,404
intellectual valid

1550
01:25:25,935 --> 01:25:27,904
validity at all. But,

1551
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:31,660
uh yeah, it's very much a well

1552
01:25:31,950 --> 01:25:34,129
established fact that

1553
01:25:34,339 --> 01:25:36,160
all of the

1554
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:41,700
people we talked about in German philosophy in the 19th century and

1555
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:45,410
Kent was mostly from the 18th century and,

1556
01:25:45,689 --> 01:25:49,069
and others like them. Uh I, I mean, I, I

1557
01:25:49,319 --> 01:25:49,950
it,

1558
01:25:49,959 --> 01:25:52,970
it's interesting that even Kent was talking about

1559
01:25:52,979 --> 01:25:57,310
universal values but apparently they didn't apply to

1560
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:58,720
uh non

1561
01:25:59,410 --> 01:26:01,069
European people

1562
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:04,100
uh curiously enough. But,

1563
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:09,390
but I, I mean, the same thing I guess happened in other sorts of instances, like,

1564
01:26:09,399 --> 01:26:10,109
for example,

1565
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:17,319
you have the French revolution and supposedly everyone should get a vote,

1566
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:19,100
everyone should get the same.

1567
01:26:19,109 --> 01:26:21,069
But it was just

1568
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:26,200
very gradually that the population in France, uh

1569
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:27,830
the adult population

1570
01:26:27,979 --> 01:26:33,220
got to AAA right to vote. I mean, first it was just

1571
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:40,410
uh one slice of the male population and then, and the same in happened in America,

1572
01:26:40,419 --> 01:26:43,319
I think, I think that initially it was just the,

1573
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:48,020
the people who, who owned land, I guess

1574
01:26:48,189 --> 01:26:52,180
-- whether the right to vote and then it was, yeah, all
-- of that was in flux.

1575
01:26:52,189 --> 01:26:54,160
For a very long time here. That's true.

1576
01:26:54,169 --> 01:26:55,919
And, and the other thing to bring up,

1577
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:59,209
I think in the context of the French revolution is the Haitian revolution.

1578
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,200
And the fact that France absolutely did

1579
01:27:02,209 --> 01:27:04,959
not want any of their revolutionary principles to

1580
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:09,970
apply to a part of the world that was primarily inhabited by Black people.

1581
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:10,850
Um So that,

1582
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:15,890
that's another classic case of um of the kind of hypocrisy that I think you're right.

1583
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,009
To me,

1584
01:27:17,020 --> 01:27:19,379
it just feels increasingly important to

1585
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:23,220
acknowledge those problems always and upfront.

1586
01:27:23,229 --> 01:27:27,169
And in every part of our discussion of these earlier thinkers,

1587
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:30,290
um and never to treat it as something we can just

1588
01:27:30,299 --> 01:27:32,810
sort of mention on the side and then move on from.

1589
01:27:33,229 --> 01:27:38,029
Um But I don't think that ignoring these people is good either because

1590
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:43,129
it's important for us to remember that even people who were intelligent and

1591
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:47,330
progressive in other ways um could make really horrendous mistakes.

1592
01:27:48,169 --> 01:27:48,779
And I,

1593
01:27:48,839 --> 01:27:51,660
and I guess that I it's not only important from

1594
01:27:51,669 --> 01:27:57,509
a sort of ethical standpoint but also intellectually speaking,

1595
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:00,399
I guess it's enriching uh to

1596
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:05,470
uh have a better understanding of how our

1597
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:11,000
socio cultural context can influence and have an impact

1598
01:28:11,129 --> 01:28:12,680
on our

1599
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:16,080
-- intellectual work, I guess.
-- Absolutely.

1600
01:28:16,089 --> 01:28:19,839
Yeah, we, we need to understand why we think what we think

1601
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:23,399
and understanding thinkers that came before us is

1602
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:25,560
an indispensable part of that for sure.

1603
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:27,359
A a and also

1604
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:31,310
keeping in keeping in mind that again,

1605
01:28:31,319 --> 01:28:37,509
people are not disembodied beings and we live and we not only have a body

1606
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:43,339
but we also live in a particular society in a particular period of time,

1607
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:45,350
in a particular culture,

1608
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:51,259
we have a ton of different in influences and we are also products of all of that

1609
01:28:51,390 --> 01:28:55,930
even intellectually. It's not that we have some sort of

1610
01:28:56,229 --> 01:28:58,930
reasoning faculty

1611
01:28:59,109 --> 01:29:05,209
that, that is impermeable to all of that and that allow us to get

1612
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:09,959
some sort of glimpse into objective reality as it is.

1613
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:11,060
Yeah.

1614
01:29:11,069 --> 01:29:13,120
And I, I'll also just say briefly,

1615
01:29:13,129 --> 01:29:17,310
that's one of the things that really fascinates me about child is that

1616
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:23,629
she was able in many ways to transcend and to

1617
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:28,089
see beyond what was absolutely the norm around her.

1618
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:30,109
And I'm really fascinated by that.

1619
01:29:30,589 --> 01:29:31,379
Um And I,

1620
01:29:31,970 --> 01:29:34,080
you know, most of your viewers will know that.

1621
01:29:34,089 --> 01:29:37,220
Um So she grew up in Boston, which is in the north

1622
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:39,779
and most northerners now

1623
01:29:40,029 --> 01:29:41,220
assume

1624
01:29:41,410 --> 01:29:46,859
that all northerners then were against slavery. And that's absolutely not true.

1625
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:48,419
Absolutely not true.

1626
01:29:48,669 --> 01:29:54,060
Many northerners actively resisted the end of slavery in the South.

1627
01:29:54,370 --> 01:29:56,830
So she was surrounded by politicians and

1628
01:29:56,839 --> 01:29:59,709
educators and journalists and religious leaders who

1629
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:05,250
actively preached that this was an acceptable way for society to be organized.

1630
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:09,049
And somehow she saw beyond it. And she, you know, she wasn't alone in that.

1631
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:10,069
And I'll also say

1632
01:30:11,009 --> 01:30:14,270
part of how she knew this is she actually talked to black people,

1633
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:18,149
right? So she actually listened to the people who were themselves affected.

1634
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:21,149
And once was able to see it from their point of view,

1635
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,899
realized that what she was hearing from the

1636
01:30:24,459 --> 01:30:27,259
leaders in her society was, was wrong.

1637
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:30,490
So again, I don't mean to suggest that she had some sort of, as you say,

1638
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:32,669
disembodied um experience,

1639
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:37,669
but she was willing to listen in a way that I take as an inspiration

1640
01:30:37,859 --> 01:30:39,549
to those of us who sometimes

1641
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:42,620
it's a kind of occupational hazard for philosophers.

1642
01:30:42,629 --> 01:30:45,459
We like to look at things from very high up.

1643
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:49,020
And often I think it takes more of a listening on the ground

1644
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:53,160
to um get real ethical insight into what needs to happen next.

1645
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:58,689
By the way, at least back in her time, how influential

1646
01:30:58,879 --> 01:31:04,629
was her, I mean, in the philosophical world and more specifically

1647
01:31:04,850 --> 01:31:07,859
in the abolitionist movement in the US,

1648
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:10,129
she was very influential.

1649
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:15,459
She, she was one of the most famous abolitionists um of the 19th century.

1650
01:31:15,959 --> 01:31:20,029
And, and part of what's so interesting about her is that she was famous before.

1651
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,299
She became an abolitionist because she

1652
01:31:22,729 --> 01:31:23,500
um

1653
01:31:23,879 --> 01:31:29,370
almost unheard of in the American 19th century by the age of 22

1654
01:31:30,049 --> 01:31:31,419
which would have been, you know, in the

1655
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:37,890
mid 18 twenties, was a very well known novelist and a self sufficient female author.

1656
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:41,959
And she'd written a couple novels and a couple of self-help books,

1657
01:31:42,299 --> 01:31:46,750
um like cooking books or books about parenting or housekeeping

1658
01:31:47,109 --> 01:31:52,259
um that had made her really beloved and trusted along among a great swath.

1659
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:56,250
I mean, she was the 19th century equivalent of a household name.

1660
01:31:56,649 --> 01:31:59,089
Um And when she became an abolitionist,

1661
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:04,129
that was so upsetting to her readers because it really meant that she was a radical

1662
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:05,529
because to be,

1663
01:32:05,540 --> 01:32:09,450
to be an abolitionist in the 18 twenties and thirties in the United States

1664
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:15,569
was to argue for the immediate end of slavery without compensation to enslavers

1665
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,060
and most Americans in the North and the

1666
01:32:18,069 --> 01:32:21,419
South thought that that was just unthinkably radical.

1667
01:32:21,709 --> 01:32:22,339
Um

1668
01:32:22,870 --> 01:32:27,970
But she, that's what she was convinced. And, you know, by the time she was about 30

1669
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:31,299
she continued to be one of the best published and

1670
01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:35,430
most um public facing intellectuals of the 19th century.

1671
01:32:35,439 --> 01:32:37,459
And certainly in the abolitionist movement

1672
01:32:37,779 --> 01:32:41,379
as far as her involvement in the philosophical community, it's interesting,

1673
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:44,720
I mean, there wasn't so much like philosophical

1674
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:49,189
tradition in the United States except really for the one that

1675
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:54,109
was getting going again in Boston around Ralph Waldo Emerson.

1676
01:32:54,620 --> 01:32:56,040
And they did know each other.

1677
01:32:56,049 --> 01:32:59,640
They were almost exact contemporaries and she was

1678
01:32:59,649 --> 01:33:01,919
admiring and would go to his lectures.

1679
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:05,310
Um But also was always concerned that he

1680
01:33:05,669 --> 01:33:10,129
was allowing the abstraction of his thought to distract

1681
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:12,370
him from what she thought he should be doing,

1682
01:33:12,509 --> 01:33:14,379
which was fighting slavery.

1683
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:19,689
So she'd sometimes say he has a platform big enough and a mind capacious enough

1684
01:33:20,180 --> 01:33:23,330
really to make arguments against slavery and he's not

1685
01:33:23,549 --> 01:33:24,330
doing it.

1686
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:29,120
Um Emerson did come around to doing that but only in 18 59

1687
01:33:29,419 --> 01:33:33,040
when John Brown's failed insurrection in Virginia

1688
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:37,520
uh convinced him that slavery needed to be um opposed.

1689
01:33:37,799 --> 01:33:38,720
So she,

1690
01:33:38,729 --> 01:33:41,100
she certainly knew all of the philosophers in the

1691
01:33:41,109 --> 01:33:43,779
Boston area of her time and socialized with them,

1692
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:44,919
communicated with them,

1693
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:49,240
but I think she feared that they had disengaged themselves from

1694
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:51,700
the moral topics of their day. Too much.

1695
01:33:53,319 --> 01:33:57,140
OK. So uh I, I'm also getting mindful of your time now.

1696
01:33:57,149 --> 01:34:03,720
So let me ask you, let me ask you one last question. Uh And let me see if, if I can

1697
01:34:03,979 --> 01:34:05,939
phrase this correctly. So,

1698
01:34:06,419 --> 01:34:08,540
uh and be clear about it. Uh

1699
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:11,470
So, uh I mean, there are

1700
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:14,899
some parts of philosophy

1701
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:18,439
that are politically motivated, like for example,

1702
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:21,479
abolitionism is a very clear example of that.

1703
01:34:22,450 --> 01:34:23,330
And

1704
01:34:23,439 --> 01:34:27,149
there are people that tend to be a little bit

1705
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:33,990
dismissive of philosophy that is done while politically motivated.

1706
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,939
And usually those people from come from

1707
01:34:38,229 --> 01:34:41,149
political positions that are opposite

1708
01:34:41,390 --> 01:34:47,850
to the, to the ones that they say are not valid philosophy, of course. So

1709
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,540
the question I wanted to ask you then is

1710
01:34:51,069 --> 01:34:57,270
how do you look at the place of a movement like abolitionism

1711
01:34:57,839 --> 01:34:58,029
uh

1712
01:34:58,180 --> 01:34:59,950
in the broader

1713
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:04,069
historical context of philosophy? And

1714
01:35:04,729 --> 01:35:05,379
uh uh

1715
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:12,939
I mean, when it comes to how people look again at politically motivated philosophy,

1716
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:14,029
I mean,

1717
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,069
to what extent

1718
01:35:16,209 --> 01:35:17,430
do you think

1719
01:35:17,569 --> 01:35:18,990
we should take it

1720
01:35:19,330 --> 01:35:22,950
seriously? And, I mean, what do you think basically about

1721
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:26,549
those people's position, the positions that,

1722
01:35:26,899 --> 01:35:30,000
oh, I, I mean, philosophy should be

1723
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:31,109
about,

1724
01:35:31,509 --> 01:35:34,620
I don't know people in academia.

1725
01:35:34,629 --> 01:35:41,520
I, I mean, it's, uh, transmitting knowledge to students shouldn't be about, uh,

1726
01:35:41,529 --> 01:35:46,009
turning them into activists or something like that.

1727
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:46,419
So,

1728
01:35:46,629 --> 01:35:52,250
uh, I, I mean, I, I hope I'm being clear in terms of the question I'm asking here.

1729
01:35:52,259 --> 01:35:54,080
But what are your thoughts on it?

1730
01:35:54,430 --> 01:35:55,149
Yeah, thank you.

1731
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:58,770
It's such a, it's such an important question to me uh now,

1732
01:35:58,779 --> 01:36:00,299
so I appreciate the chance to

1733
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:02,080
think about it. Um

1734
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:04,229
I guess

1735
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:06,750
a couple of things, first of all,

1736
01:36:06,759 --> 01:36:11,390
philosophy has not always been removed from reality.

1737
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:16,870
And I think like the story of the 19th century into the 20th century

1738
01:36:17,319 --> 01:36:18,620
uh is

1739
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:25,910
much more about philosophy deciding to extract itself from practice.

1740
01:36:26,410 --> 01:36:29,549
And there are historical reasons for that,

1741
01:36:29,810 --> 01:36:35,290
but I think we're wrong if we assume and I this isn't what you were saying either.

1742
01:36:35,299 --> 01:36:38,490
But I think some of the people you're thinking about would say this, that,

1743
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:40,689
that real philosophy

1744
01:36:41,419 --> 01:36:45,100
shouldn't dirty its hands or shouldn't kind of get involved

1745
01:36:45,109 --> 01:36:47,939
in the world because then it's not as pure,

1746
01:36:47,950 --> 01:36:51,540
that's, that's a choice that philosophy has made

1747
01:36:51,839 --> 01:36:55,540
relatively recently as a discipline and it

1748
01:36:55,549 --> 01:36:59,299
has to do with the professionalization of philosophy

1749
01:36:59,479 --> 01:37:01,709
um in the 19th century, in the United States.

1750
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:05,819
Well, the three cases I know most about are the US, the UK and Germany,

1751
01:37:07,259 --> 01:37:12,709
you, you couldn't get a degree in philosophy no matter who you were in for a long time.

1752
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:13,520
Right. Phd.

1753
01:37:13,529 --> 01:37:17,640
S weren't invented that long ago and even after they were invented, they weren't

1754
01:37:17,850 --> 01:37:21,979
necessary to philosophizing philosophical journals did not

1755
01:37:21,990 --> 01:37:24,520
use to require that you came from.

1756
01:37:24,779 --> 01:37:25,279
Um,

1757
01:37:25,390 --> 01:37:27,549
you had a phd in philosophy to

1758
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:28,490
publish.

1759
01:37:28,500 --> 01:37:29,890
So, so the,

1760
01:37:29,899 --> 01:37:33,250
the professionalization of philosophy has meant that what it means

1761
01:37:33,259 --> 01:37:36,140
to do philosophy has gotten narrower and narrower and narrower,

1762
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:38,169
more elitist, more professionalized.

1763
01:37:38,259 --> 01:37:43,609
But there's a very long history of philosophy being born out of

1764
01:37:43,979 --> 01:37:47,470
grappling with the real world as it were.

1765
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:50,589
Um And I don't think there's been a social movement

1766
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:54,609
in history that hasn't required people to think philosophically.

1767
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:58,379
Um I mean, Angela Davis is a great example of someone who

1768
01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:02,700
uh was doing a phd in philosophy before she became

1769
01:38:02,709 --> 01:38:06,689
an activist and brought her um studies in Spinoza and

1770
01:38:06,830 --> 01:38:11,470
Kant and Hegel to her struggle for racial justice in the United States.

1771
01:38:11,709 --> 01:38:14,470
But I think pretty much anywhere you look, you would find

1772
01:38:15,569 --> 01:38:18,359
people who are fighting for justice thinking philosophically.

1773
01:38:18,370 --> 01:38:21,419
And I've been very happy to see people emphasizing that more.

1774
01:38:21,529 --> 01:38:25,549
So people are writing about Martin Luther King as a philosopher for instance.

1775
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:27,089
-- Um
-- And yeah,

1776
01:38:27,100 --> 01:38:30,689
I was going to say that perhaps another excellent example would

1777
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:34,799
be the civil rights movement in the 19 sixties and seventies.

1778
01:38:35,049 --> 01:38:36,189
-- Yeah,
-- exactly. So,

1779
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:37,850
so I think a,

1780
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:38,009
a

1781
01:38:38,229 --> 01:38:41,930
more or an alternate model and I think in some ways,

1782
01:38:41,939 --> 01:38:44,740
a truer model to philosophy's history is that

1783
01:38:44,990 --> 01:38:48,129
when people are confronted with injustices,

1784
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:50,399
they have to ask those bigger questions.

1785
01:38:50,589 --> 01:38:53,149
And I think what philosophy can do to empower us

1786
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:55,870
is to give us some clarity about those questions.

1787
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:58,390
So, you know, really what is justice?

1788
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:02,339
Um you know, we can go back to the Republic to find people trying to figure that out.

1789
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:05,419
And so when I teach philosophy,

1790
01:39:05,430 --> 01:39:09,959
I don't at all think of myself as trying to turn my students into activists.

1791
01:39:09,970 --> 01:39:12,430
But I do think that I want them to see

1792
01:39:12,439 --> 01:39:17,540
that philosophy can be a really powerful and even essential tool

1793
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:22,350
for understanding the terms of our debates and

1794
01:39:22,359 --> 01:39:24,609
the kinds of things we want to fight for

1795
01:39:24,779 --> 01:39:27,660
and then giving us the clarity of thought

1796
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:29,459
that can motivate

1797
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:30,459
action.

1798
01:39:30,680 --> 01:39:33,569
So when, when I think about the way movements

1799
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:34,470
work,

1800
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:36,740
sometimes what happens is people just aren't

1801
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:40,259
particularly clear what they're fighting for and why

1802
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:44,169
and what that means is that whenever there's infighting or tension or unclear,

1803
01:39:44,180 --> 01:39:46,379
like you can just lose focus and get,

1804
01:39:46,549 --> 01:39:49,509
you know, distracted by the details. But the better you are

1805
01:39:49,770 --> 01:39:52,390
at saying no, I thought this through philosophically,

1806
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:54,020
even if you don't phrase it that way.

1807
01:39:54,149 --> 01:39:57,399
This is what is important, this is what back to Hagel

1808
01:39:58,299 --> 01:40:01,330
really creating a society in which people can

1809
01:40:01,339 --> 01:40:04,700
truly be free and not just abstractly free.

1810
01:40:04,709 --> 01:40:06,330
This is what it would look like

1811
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:09,919
that that is empowering and motivating

1812
01:40:10,149 --> 01:40:15,069
in a way that can help us stave off the kind of burnout or fatalism

1813
01:40:15,259 --> 01:40:20,759
that is all too often the death of movements for justice.

1814
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:26,100
So I would prefer to think philosophy is as something that is born out of

1815
01:40:26,339 --> 01:40:30,049
humans, just trying to figure our way out in the world.

1816
01:40:30,279 --> 01:40:34,500
And the more those of us who are inclined to think philosophically can

1817
01:40:35,049 --> 01:40:37,569
articulate those thoughts and help people think them through.

1818
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:40,479
I think the better chance philosophy has of

1819
01:40:40,490 --> 01:40:42,319
actually fulfilling a good purpose in the world.

1820
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:48,410
Yeah, a and perhaps, I mean, people who might be worried uh

1821
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:50,009
about

1822
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:52,620
keeping some of the

1823
01:40:52,750 --> 01:40:58,709
philosophical traditions of the West, perhaps they should also keep in mind that

1824
01:40:59,060 --> 01:41:05,080
if Plato is the father of Western philosophy, then

1825
01:41:05,259 --> 01:41:08,500
he wrote a book titled The Republic,

1826
01:41:08,689 --> 01:41:09,740
which

1827
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:14,700
which I I it would be very hard to argue that it's

1828
01:41:14,709 --> 01:41:21,419
not politically motivated because it's literally a book about how to,

1829
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:26,390
to, to structure politically a society from top to bottom.

1830
01:41:26,439 --> 01:41:26,899
So,

1831
01:41:27,479 --> 01:41:27,709
-- yeah,
-- very

1832
01:41:28,020 --> 01:41:28,100
good.

1833
01:41:28,229 --> 01:41:31,220
Yeah, absolutely. And the more I think we recognize that

1834
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:35,899
philosophy has been done in many different ways.

1835
01:41:36,060 --> 01:41:37,959
So like the academic article

1836
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:39,279
really new,

1837
01:41:39,649 --> 01:41:39,709
I mean,

1838
01:41:39,720 --> 01:41:43,049
we think about like Plato writing and dialogues

1839
01:41:43,060 --> 01:41:45,379
and Aristotle giving lectures and you know,

1840
01:41:45,390 --> 01:41:45,589
k

1841
01:41:45,729 --> 01:41:48,839
writing something more that we recognize as philosophy,

1842
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:52,229
but people writing philosophically through literature, Nietzsche

1843
01:41:52,359 --> 01:41:54,069
through aphorisms, like

1844
01:41:54,339 --> 01:41:56,959
many of our most important philosophers have been

1845
01:41:56,970 --> 01:42:01,080
really disruptive of what people thought philosophy was.

1846
01:42:01,479 --> 01:42:06,779
And so I, I do not feel like my time is well spent fighting for

1847
01:42:07,399 --> 01:42:10,759
a version of philosophy that I think is pretty historically contingent,

1848
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:15,700
sometimes harmful and not where the real energy of philosophy

1849
01:42:15,839 --> 01:42:16,509
should be

1850
01:42:18,149 --> 01:42:18,959
great.

1851
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:26,330
So, uh let's wrap up the interview here then uh just before we go and by the way,

1852
01:42:26,339 --> 01:42:28,779
I'm also leaving a link in the description box

1853
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:32,240
to your book Lydia on Lydia Maria Child.

1854
01:42:32,450 --> 01:42:34,490
Uh and apart from the book,

1855
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:38,850
would you like to tell people where they can find you and your work on the internet?

1856
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:43,580
Yes, thank you. I do have a website which is just Lydia Moland dot com.

1857
01:42:43,589 --> 01:42:46,229
And I am also on Twitter.

1858
01:42:46,709 --> 01:42:50,060
I think that's Lydia underscore Moland

1859
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:54,419
and I have maybe two things on Instagram.

1860
01:42:54,839 --> 01:42:59,160
So I'm not, uh I'm not, never been a big social media person.

1861
01:42:59,169 --> 01:43:01,500
I'm getting my dipping my toes in a little bit, but

1862
01:43:01,839 --> 01:43:05,939
um Twitter is where I post the most and I do try to keep the website updated.

1863
01:43:05,950 --> 01:43:08,779
So people are more interested in in any of my writing.

1864
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:10,979
Um All of my writing is listed on the website

1865
01:43:11,109 --> 01:43:13,700
and what I'm working on now is um findable on Twitter.

1866
01:43:14,439 --> 01:43:15,279
Ok, great.

1867
01:43:15,290 --> 01:43:16,339
So, Doctor Molan,

1868
01:43:16,350 --> 01:43:21,339
